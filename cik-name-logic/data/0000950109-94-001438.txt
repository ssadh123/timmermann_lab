Subsidiaries currently own, lease, mine and operate its properties and to
conduct the business now operated by it as described in the Registration
Statement and Prospectus, the absence of which could reasonably be expected to

considered as a whole, and neither the Company nor any of its Material
Subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation
or modification of any such consent, approval, certificate, authorization,
registration, qualification, license, concession or permit which, individually

issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain as soon as practicable the withdrawal thereof.

(b) If, at any time when a Prospectus relating to the Securities is 
required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which
the Registration Statement, as then amended, or the Prospectus, as then
supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact, any facts or events arise which, individually or in
the aggregate, would represent a material change in the information set forth
in the Registration Statement, as then amended, or the Prospectus, as then
supplemented, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement
or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the rules or
regulations thereunder or, with respect to any information incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, the Exchange Act or the
rules or regulations thereunder, the Company will promptly (i) prepare and
file with the Commission, subject to paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an
amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission, reflect
such change or effect such compliance and (ii) supply such amended
Registration Statement or supplemented Prospectus to the Representatives in
such quantities as they may reasonably request.

(c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to
its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.

(d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the
Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement and
all amendments thereto (including all exhibits thereto) and to each other
Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto

Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of the
Prospectus and any Preliminary

Prospectus and any supplements thereto as the Representatives may request.

(e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for
sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate
and will maintain such qualifications in effect for so long as required for
the distribution of the Securities; provided, that no such qualification shall
-------- ----
be required in any jurisdiction where, solely as a result thereof, the Company
would be subject to taxation or qualification as a foreign corporation doing
business in such jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or required to
take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other
than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any
jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. In addition, the Company will
arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase
by institutional investors and will pay the fee of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with its review of the offering.

(f) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of
preemptive and other rights, sufficient shares of Common Stock to satisfy any
obligations to issue shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Securities.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its directors or officers will, for a
period of 90 days following the Execution Time, without the prior written
consent of the Representatives, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, (i) any
shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable
for, shares of Common Stock or (ii) shares of any class of capital stock of
the Company which is preferred as to the payment of dividends, or as to the
distribution of assets upon any liquidation or dissolution of the Company,
over shares of any other class of capital stock of the Company; provided,
--------
however, that the Company may offer, issue and sell Common Stock pursuant to
-------
the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan, the Nonemployee Directors' Stock
Grant Plan, or any employee stock option plan, thrift plan, excess benefit
plan or dividend reinvestment plan of the Company in effect at the Execution
Time, the DOCLOC Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Company
may issue Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of securities or the
exercise of warrants outstanding on the date of this Agreement.

of the Securities and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Securities on The New York Stock Exchange.

-13-

correspondence to and from, and all documents issued to and by, the Commission
in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act or The New
York Stock Exchange in connection with the listing of the Securities and of
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Securities.

(j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will issue no press release 
or other communication directly or indirectly and hold no press conference
with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or with respect to the
financial condition, results of operations, business, properties, assets,
liabilities or prospects of any of them, or the offering of the Securities,
without your prior consent which will not be unreasonably withheld.

(k) The Company confirms as of the date hereof that it is in compliance 
with all provisions of Section 1 of Laws of Florida, Chapter 92-198, 
An Act Relating to Disclosure of Doing Business with Cuba, and the Company

further agrees that if it commences engaging in business with the government
of Cuba or with any person or affiliate located in Cuba after the date the
Registration Statement becomes or has become effective with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or with the Florida Department of Banking and Finance (the
"Florida Department"), whichever date is later, or if the information reported
in the Prospectus, if any, concerning the Company's business with Cuba or with
any person or affiliate located in Cuba changes in any material way, the
Company will provide the Florida Department notice of such business or change,
as appropriate, in a form acceptable to the Florida Department for so long as
the Florida Department requires such notice.

6. Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations 
-------------------------------------------------
of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten Securities and the Option

representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of

-14-
<PAGE>

(b) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives, on behalf 
of the Underwriters, the opinion of Paul J. Hemschoot, Jr., Vice President,
Secretary and General Counsel of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the
effect that:

(i) all the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Material 
Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully
paid and nonassess able, and, except as otherwise set forth in the
Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Material
Subsidiaries are owned by the Company either directly or through wholly-
owned Material Subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security
interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, any other security
interests, claims, liens or encumbrances, except as described in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993;

(ii) to such counsel's knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its
Material Subsidiaries is in breach of, or in default under (nor has any
event occurred which with notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute
a breach of or default under), any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
credit agreement, contract, license or other agreement or instrument to
which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of them or their respective properties may be bound or affected
where such breach or default could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its Material Subsidiaries
considered as a whole;

(iii) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and 
delivered by the Company;

(iv) neither the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the issuance
of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will conflict
with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under (or constitute
any event which with notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
breach of or default under) the terms of any material indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, credit agreement, contract, license or other material
agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Material
Subsidiaries is a party or bound;

(v) to the knowledge of such counsel, there is no pending or 
threatened action, suit, investigation or proceeding before any court or
governmental agency,

-15-
<PAGE>

authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its
Material Subsidiaries of a character required to be disclosed or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus which
is not adequately disclosed or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus; and

(vi) to such counsel's knowledge, no person has the right, 
contractual or otherwise, to cause the Company to issue, or register
pursuant to the Act, any shares of capital stock of the Company upon the
issue and sale of the Securities to be sold by the Company to the
Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or upon the issuance of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, nor does any
person have preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or other rights to
purchase any capital stock of the Company.

In addition, such counsel shall state that no facts have come to such
counsel's attention that lead him to believe that, as of the Effective Date,
when the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement was filed with the Commission in
accordance with Rule 424(b), at the Execution Time, when the Prospectus
Supplement was filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) or on
the Closing Date, the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto filed
with the Commission by the Company prior to the Closing Date, contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
or that, as of its date, the Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus
Supplement, Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, and any amendment or
supplement thereto filed with the Commission by the Company prior to the Closing
Date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Closing
Date, the Prospectus, as then supplemented, contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading (it being understood that such counsel has not been requested to and
does not express any view with respect to the financial statements, financial
schedules, geological and engineering reports and other financial, statistical,
geological and engineering information contained or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus Supplement
and Prospectus Supplement, as so amended or supplemented).

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters
involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
New York, to the extent he deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the
opinion of other counsel of

-16-
<PAGE>

good standing whom he believes to be reliable and who are reasonably
satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to
the extent he deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the
Company and public officials. References to the Prospectus in this paragraph
(b) include any supplements thereto.

(c) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives, on behalf 
of the Underwriters, the opinion of Davis, Graham & Stubbs, counsel for the
Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

(i) the Company and each of its Material Subsidiaries has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized,
with full corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions in which the character of properties owned,
leased, licensed or otherwise held by the Company or one of its Material
Subsidiaries or the transaction of business by the Company or one of its
Material Subsidiaries as now conducted requires such qualification and
where the failure to be so qualified would have a material adverse effect
on the Company and its Material Subsidiaries considered as a whole;

(ii) the Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth 
in the Prospectus; the capital stock of the Company conforms to the
description thereof contained in the Prospectus; the issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock have been duly and validly
authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; the Securities
have been duly and validly authorized and, when issued and delivered to and
paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, will be fully paid
and nonassessable and will be free of any pledge, lien, security interest,
encumbrance, claim or preemptive or other rights; the Securities are
convertible at the option of the holders thereof into shares of Common
Stock as described in the Prospectus, the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Securities have been duly and validly reserved for
issuance and when issued at the option of the holders of the Securities
will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and will be free of
any pledge, lien, security interest, encumbrance, claim or preemptive or
other rights; the Securities and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Securities are duly

-17-
<PAGE>

authorized for listing, subject to official notice of issuance or sale, as
the case may be, on The New York Stock Exchange; the certificates for the
Securities are in valid and sufficient form; and the holders of outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company are not entitled to preemptive or,
to the knowledge of such counsel, other rights to subscribe for the
Securities or shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Securities;

(iii) to the knowledge of such counsel, there is no mortgage, 
indenture, contract or other agreement of a character required to be
described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, to be incorporated
by reference therein, or to be filed as an exhibit thereto, which is not
described, incorporated by reference, or filed as required; the statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus describing material
agreements fairly summarize such agreements; the description contained in
the Prospectus under the heading "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences"
constitutes a fair summary of the statutes and regulations discussed
therein as applicable to the offering and ownership of the Securities;

(iv) the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; 
any required filing of the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, pursuant
to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period
required by Rule 424(b); no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been received by the Company and, to the
knowledge of such counsel, no proceedings for that purpose have been
instituted or threatened; the Registration Statement (and any amendments
thereto) and the Prospectus (and any supplements thereto) (other than the
financial statements, related schedules, geological and engineering reports
and other financial, geological, engineering and statistical information
contained therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Act and, as applicable, the rules and regulations thereunder and the
Exchange Act and, as applicable, the rules and regulations thereunder;

(v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration 
Statement and any amendments thereto and the Prospectus and any supplements
thereto (other than the financial statements, related schedules, geological
and engineering reports and other financial, geological, engineering and
statistical information contained therein as to which such counsel need
express no opinion), when

-18-
<PAGE>

they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder;

(vi) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Company;

(vii) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or

securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and such
other approvals (which shall be specified in such opinion) as have been
obtained;

(viii) neither the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the 
issuance of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Securities, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under
(or constitute any event which with notice, lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a breach of or default under) the certificate or articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries
or the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit agreement,
contract, license or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or
any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or bound that is filed as an
exhibit to the Registration Statement, or, to such counsel's knowledge, any
order or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Material
Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency,
governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any
of its Material Subsidiaries; and

(ix) to such counsel's knowledge, no person has the right, 
contractual or otherwise, to cause the Company to issue, or register
pursuant to the Act, any shares of capital stock of the Company upon the
issue and sale of the Securities to be sold by the Company to the
Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or upon the issuance of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, nor, to such
counsel's knowledge, does any person have preemptive rights, rights of
first refusal or other rights to purchase any capital stock of the Company.

-19-
<PAGE>

In addition, such counsel shall state that no facts have come to such
counsel's attention that lead them to believe that, as of the Effective Date,
when the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement was filed with the Commission in
accordance with Rule 424(b), at the Execution Time, when the Prospectus
Supplement was filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) or on
the Closing Date, the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto filed
with the Commission by the Company prior to the Closing Date, contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
or that, as of its date, the Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus
Supplement, Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, and any amendment or
supplement thereto filed with the Commission by the Company prior to the Closing
Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Closing
Date, the Prospectus, as then supplemented, contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading (it being understood that such counsel have not been requested to and
do not express any view with respect to the financial statements, financial
schedules, geological and engineering reports and other financial, statistical,
geological and engineering information contained or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus Supplement
and Prospectus Supplement, as so amended or supplemented).

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters
involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Colorado, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the
opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and
who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to
matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible
officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Prospectus in
this paragraph (c) include any supplements thereto.

(d) The Representatives shall have received from Winston & Strawn, 
counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing
Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may
reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel all
such information, instruments, certificates and documents as they may
reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

-20-
<PAGE>

(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a 
certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the
Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such
certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any supplements to the Prospectus and this Agreement and that:

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this 
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the
Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the
Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the
conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the

(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement has been received by the Company and no proceedings for that
purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened;
and

(iii) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements
included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, and except as set
forth in the Prospectus, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Material
Subsidiaries has incurred any material liabilities or obligations, direct
or contingent, or entered into any material transactions not in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice, and
(B) there has not been any material adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise), business, prospects, net worth or results of
operations of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries or any change
in the capital stock or increase in the long-term debt of the Company or
any of its Material Subsidiaries.

(f) At the Execution Time and on the Closing Date, Price Waterhouse, with
respect to clause (ii) below and, to the extent applicable, clauses (iii) and
(iv) below, and Coopers & Lybrand with respect to clause (i) below and, to the
extent applicable, clauses (iii) and (iv) below, shall each have furnished to
the Representatives a letter or letters, dated respectively as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory
to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants
within the meaning of the Act and Exchange Act and the applicable rules and
regulations thereunder and stating to the extent applicable that:

-21-
<PAGE>

(i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial
statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus and reported on by them comply in
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
of the Act and Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations;

(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial 
statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out
certain specified procedures (but not an audit in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of
significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a
reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and
executive, audit and other board committees of the Company and its
subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have
responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its
subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the
most recent audited financial statements and financial statement schedules
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus; nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe
that:

(1) the unaudited financial statements included or 
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus
do not comply in form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Act and Exchange Act and with the rules
and regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements
included or incorporated by reference in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-
Q under the Exchange Act; or said unaudited financial statements are
not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus;

(2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the 
most recent financial statements and financial statement schedules
(other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included
or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than
five business days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term
debt of the Company and its

-22-
<PAGE>

subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company and its subsidiaries, or
decreases in the stockholders' equity of the Company and its
subsidiaries or increases in the short-term debt of the Company and
its subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement and Prospectus, or for the period from the
date of the most recent financial statements and financial statement
schedules (other than any capsule information) included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus
to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the
corresponding period in the preceding year, in net sales or income
before income taxes or in total or per share amounts of net income of
the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes
(increases or decreases) set forth in such letter, in which case the
letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the
significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary
by the Representatives;

(iii) the amounts included in any unaudited "capsule" information 
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited
financial statements for the same periods or were not determined on a basis
substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the
audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus; and

(iv) they have performed certain other specified procedures, in 
form and substance acceptable to the Representatives, as a result of which
they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or
statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or
statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the
Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its
subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.

References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (f) include any supplements
thereto at the date of the letters.

(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the respective 
dates as of which information is given in the

-23-
<PAGE>

Registration Statement and Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any
change or increase or decrease specified in the letters referred to in
paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development
involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, assets,
operations, financial condition, properties or prospects of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause
(i) or (ii) above, is, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives,
material and adverse enough to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed
with the public offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the
Registration Statement and Prospectus.

(h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any 
decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt or equity securities by
any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for
purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or
potential decrease in any such rating or of any review of or any possible
change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible
change.

(i) At the Execution Time, the Company shall have furnished to the
Representatives a letter from Cyprus and each officer and director of the
Company, addressed to the Representatives, in which each such person agrees
not to offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or
indirectly, or announce an offering of, any shares of Common or Preferred
Stock beneficially owned by such person or any securities convertible into, or
exchangeable for, any shares of Common or Preferred Stock for a period of 90
days following the Execution Time without the prior written consent of the
Representatives, other than shares of Common Stock disposed of by officers and
directors as bona fide gifts.

(j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the
Representatives and rating agencies such further information, certificates and
documents as the Representatives or any rating agency may reasonably request.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not, in the
reasonable judgment of the Representatives, have been fulfilled in all material
respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions,
certificates or letters mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not
be in all material respects satisfactory in form and substance to the
Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the
Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing
Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the
Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

(a) The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that 
the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees,

the cost and charges of any transfer agent or registrar; and (viii) all other
costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder
which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. The Company
shall not be liable to any of the Underwriters for loss of anticipated profits
from the transaction covered by this Agreement.

(b) If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated
because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in
Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to
Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of
the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof
other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will
reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses
(including fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been reasonably
incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the
Securities. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not
consummated for any other reason, the Company shall not be obligated to
reimburse the Underwriters for their out-of-pocket expenses.

each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act or the
Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint
or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the
Exchange Act or any other Federal, state or foreign statutory law or regulation,
at common law, in equity or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally
filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Basic
Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to
reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other
expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the
-------- ------- 
Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives
specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof, and (ii) such
indemnity with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from
whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased
the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a
copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) excluding
documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of
the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is
required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact
contained in such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus (or
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) and, if a copy of such Prospectus
(or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) had been so sent or given, such
delivery would have cured the defect giving rise to the claim asserted by such
person and it is finally judicially determined that such delivery was required
to be made under the Act and was not so made. This indemnity agreement will be
in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the
Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the
meaning of either the Act or Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to
written

-26-
<PAGE>

information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on
behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in
the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This
indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter
may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the statements set
forth under the heading "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement
and Prospectus Supplement constitute the only information furnished in writing
by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or
any Preliminary Prospectus, and the several Underwriters hereby confirm that
such statements are correct in all material respects.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this
Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof,
but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified
party, unless the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall have
materially impaired the defense of such claim. In case any such action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to appoint
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to represent the
indemnified party in such action; provided, however, that if the defendants in
-------- ------- 
any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the
indemnified party or parties shall have the right to defend such action, at the
indemnifying party's expense, on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.
Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of
its election so to appoint counsel to defend such action and approval by the
indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to
such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in
accordance with the proviso to the immediate preceding sentence (it being
understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the
expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by
the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 8, representing
the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such
action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within
a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the

-27-
<PAGE>

action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel
for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. An
indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or
proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential
parties to such claim, action, suit or proceeding) unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified
party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding effected without its prior written consent.

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in 
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 8 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason
unavailable or insufficient (including, without limitation, because of any
holding by a court that such indemnification is unenforceable or otherwise
unavailable on grounds of public policy or otherwise), the Company and the
Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and
liabilities (including legal or other expenses incurred in connection with
investigating or defending same) (collectively, "Losses") to which the Company
and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the
Underwriters from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no
-------- -------
case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in the agreement among
underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any
amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities
purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the
immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and
the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the
Company and of the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to
the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting
expenses) and benefits received by the several Underwriters shall be deemed to
be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as
set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be
determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission
relates to information provided by the Company or the Underwriters and the
parties' relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the
Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were
determined by pro rata allocation or any other

-28-
<PAGE>

method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph
(d), each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act or
Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter
shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person
who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act or Exchange Act, each
officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each
director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Company. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of
notice of commencement of any action, suit or preceding against such party in
respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or
parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom
contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties
shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from
any obligation it or they may have hereunder.

9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall 
-------------------------
fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by
such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall
constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this
Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up
and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set
forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate amount of
Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the
Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to
purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of
-------- -------
Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to
purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in
Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase
all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities,
and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this
Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or
the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this
Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding
seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that required
changes in the Registration Statement and Prospectus or in any other documents
or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
relieve a defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and
nondefaulting Underwriters for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

-29-
<PAGE>

10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the
----------- 
absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior
to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading
in the Company's Common Stock or other securities shall have been suspended by
the Commission, The New York Stock Exchange, The American Stock Exchange or The
Toronto Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on The New York Stock
Exchange or any other national securities exchange or market shall have been
suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on The New
York Stock Exchange or any such other exchange or market, (ii) a banking
moratorium shall have been declared by Federal, Colorado or New York authorities
or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities,
declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other
calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets is such as to
make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to
proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the
Prospectus.

11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective 
------------------------------------------
agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the
Company or its officers or directors and of the Underwriters set forth in or
made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Representatives, any
Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents
or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive
delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8
hereof shall survive any termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and 
-------
effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed,
delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at Salomon Brothers Inc, Seven

13. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be

binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers
and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and no
other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

OF

AMAX GOLD INC.

PAR VALUE $1.00 PER SHARE
LIQUIDATION VALUE $50 PER SHARE

PURSUANT TO SECTION 151 OF THE GENERAL
CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

The undersigned duly authorized officer of Amax Gold Inc., a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the
"Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), and pursuant to Section
151 thereof, hereby certifies as follows:

FIRST: The Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the
Corporation authorizes the issuance of up to 210,000,000 shares of capital
stock, of which 200,000,000 shares shall be shares of common stock, par value
$.01 per share ("Common Stock"); and 10,000,000 shares shall be shares of
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Preferred Stock").

SECOND: The Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the
Corporation, authorizes the Board of Directors of the Corporation to provide for
the issuance of Preferred Stock in one or more series, with such designation,
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be
stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of
such series adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, subject to the
limitations prescribed by law and except as otherwise provided in the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment thereto.

THIRD: Pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the
Corporation by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the
Corporation under the provisions of Section 151 of the DGCL, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, at a meeting duly held on July 26, 1994, and the
Pricing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, by written consent
dated August 4, 1994, adopted the following resolutions providing for an issue
of a series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock, which resolutions are still in
full force and effect and are not in conflict with any provision of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Corporation:
<PAGE>

"RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors
of the Corporation by Section 151 of the DGCL and the provisions of its Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, an issue of a series of the Preferred
Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation is hereby created,
consisting of 1,840,000 shares, with the designations, powers, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series as follows:

(1) Designation, Number of Shares and Rank. The designation of such 
-------------------------------------- 
series shall be "$3.75 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock" (hereinafter
referred to as the "Series B Convertible Preferred Stock"). Each share of Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects with the other
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.

All shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall rank prior, both
as to payment of dividends and as to distributions of assets upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary,
to all of the Corporation's now or hereafter issued Common Stock.

(2) Dividends. The holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred 
--------- 
Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, but only out of funds legally available therefor,
dividends at the annual rate of $3.75 per share, and no more, which shall be
fully cumulative, shall accrue without interest from the date of first issuance
and shall be payable in cash in equal quarterly installments on the 1st day of
August 15, November 15, February 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on
November 15, 1994 (except that if any such date is not a business day, then such
dividend shall be payable on the next succeeding business day) (each, a
"Dividend Payment Date"), to stockholders of record as they appear on the stock
transfer books of the Corporation on such record dates, not more than 60 nor
less than 10 days preceding such Dividend Payment Date, as are fixed by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation. For the purposes hereof, the term
"business day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday
which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by
law or executive order to close in New York, New York. Subject to the next
paragraph of this Section 2, dividends on account of arrears for any past
dividend periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any
Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date, not exceeding 45 days
preceding the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation. The amount of dividends payable per share of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock for each quarterly dividend period shall be computed
by dividing the annual amount by four. The amount of dividends payable on the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for the initial dividend period and for any
period less than a full quarterly dividend period shall be

-2-
<PAGE>

computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be entitled
to any dividend whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of the
full cumulative dividends on such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock.

On each Dividend Payment Date all dividends which shall have accrued on
each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding on such Dividend
Payment Date shall accumulate and be deemed to become "due" whether or not
declared and whether or not there shall be funds legally available for the
payment thereof. Any dividend which shall not be paid on the Dividend Payment
Date on which it shall become due shall be deemed to be "past due" until such
dividend shall be paid or until the share of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock with respect to which such dividend became due shall no longer be
outstanding, whichever is the earlier to occur. No interest or sum of money or
other property or securities in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of
any dividend payment or payments which are past due. Dividends paid on shares of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of
such dividends at the time accumulated and payable on such shares shall be
allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time
outstanding.

No dividends or other distributions, other than dividends payable solely in
shares of Common Stock, shall be paid, or declared and set apart for payment in
respect of, and no purchase, redemption or other acquisition for any
consideration shall be made by the Corporation of and no sinking fund or other
analogous fund payments shall be made in respect of any shares of Common Stock
or other capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to dividends or as
to liquidation rights to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Junior
Dividend Stock") unless and until all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock, including the full dividend for the then current
dividend period, shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment and
the Corporation is not in default in respect of the optional redemption of any
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.

No dividends or other distributions shall be paid or declared and set apart
for payment and no purchase, redemption or other acquisition for any
consideration shall be made by the Corporation of, and no sinking fund or other
analogous fund payments shall be made in respect of, any class or series of the
Corporation's capital stock ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Parity Dividend Stock"), including
any then outstanding $2.25 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00
per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), for any period unless full
cumulative dividends have been, or contemporaneously are, paid or declared and
set apart for such payment on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for all
dividend payment periods

-3-
<PAGE>

terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative
dividends. No dividends shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment on
the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative
dividends have been, or contemporaneously are, paid or declared and set apart
for payment on the Parity Dividend Stock for all dividend periods terminating on
or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative dividends. When
dividends are not paid in full upon the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and
the Parity Dividend Stock, all dividends paid or declared and set apart for
payment upon shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the Parity
Dividend Stock shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment pro rata so
that the amount of dividends paid or declared and set apart for payment per
share on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the Parity Dividend Stock
shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid
dividends per share on the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and
the Parity Dividend Stock bear to each other.

The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to
purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of capital stock of
the Corporation or any Parity Dividend Stock unless the Corporation could, under
this Section 2, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in
such manner. Any reference to "distribution" contained in this Section 2 shall
not be deemed to include any distribution made in connection with any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary.

(3) Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution
---------------------- 
or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders
of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
out of the assets of the Corporation, whether such assets are stated capital or
surplus of any nature, an amount equal to the dividends accrued and unpaid
thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders, whether or not
declared, without interest, and a sum equal to $50.00 per share, and no more,
before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of
Common Stock or any other class or series of the Corporation's capital stock
ranking junior as to liquidation rights to the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock (the "Junior Liquidation Stock"). In the event the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to stockholders upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary,
shall be insufficient to pay in full the amounts payable with respect to the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the
Corporation's capital stock which has been or may hereafter be created ranking
on a parity as to liquidation rights with the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock (the "Parity Liquidation Stock"), including any then outstanding Series A
Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the
holders of the Parity Liquidation Stock shall share ratably in any distribution
of

-4-
<PAGE>

assets of the Corporation in proportion to the full respective preferential
amounts to which they are entitled (but only to the extent of such preferential
amounts). After payment in full of the liquidation preferences of the shares of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the holders of such shares shall not be
entitled to any further participation in any distribution of assets by the
Corporation. Neither a consolidation, merger or other business combination of
the Corporation with or into another corporation or other entity nor a sale or
transfer of all or part of the Corporation's assets for cash, securities or
other property shall be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation for purposes of this Section 3 (unless in connection therewith
the liquidation of the Corporation is specifically approved).

The holder of any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not
be entitled to receive any payment owed for such shares under this Section 3
until such holder shall cause to be delivered to the Corporation (i) the
certificate(s) representing such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
and (ii) transfer instrument(s) satisfactory to the Corporation and sufficient
to transfer such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the
Corporation free of any liens or encumbrances thereon or rights of third parties
thereto. As in the case of the Redemption Price referred to below, no interest
shall accrue on any payment upon liquidation after the due date thereof.

(4) Redemption at the Option of the Corporation.
------------------------------------------- 

(a) Right of Redemption. Subject to and upon compliance with the
------------------- 
provisions of this Section 4, the Corporation, at its option, may at any time
redeem the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time
in part, on any date on or after August 15, 1997 set by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation, at the following redemption prices per share, if redeemed
during the 12-month period commencing on August 15, of the year indicated:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

1997............................................. $52.625

</TABLE>

plus in each case accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date of
redemption.

-5-
<PAGE>

In case of the redemption of less than all of the then outstanding Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
to be redeemed shall be redeemed pro rata or by lot or in such other equitable
manner as the Board of Directors of the Corporation reasonably may determine.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not redeem less than all of
the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock at any time outstanding until all
dividends accrued and in arrears upon all Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
and Parity Dividend Stock then outstanding shall have been paid for all past
dividend periods.

(b) Manner of Exercise of Redemption Option. In order to exercise 
--------------------------------------- 
its redemption option, the Corporation must give written notice in person or by
first class mail, postage prepaid, of such redemption to each holder of record
of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at such
holder's address as it shall appear upon the stock transfer books of the
Corporation not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days prior to the redemption
date. Each such notice of redemption shall state, as appropriate: (1) the date
fixed for redemption; (2) the number of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all of the shares held by such holder
are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder;
(3) the Redemption Price per share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (4)
the place or places of payment that payment of the Redemption Price will be made
upon presentation and surrender of the certificate or certificates evidencing
the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (5) that on
and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares;
and (6) the then effective Conversion Price pursuant to Section 5 and that the
right of holders to convert shall terminate at the close of business on the
redemption date (unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the
Redemption Price).

Any notice that is delivered or mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock receives such notice; and failure to give
such notice, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. On
or after the date fixed for redemption as stated in such notice, each holder of
the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall
surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing such shares to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall thereupon be
entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price as herein provided. If less
than all the shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.
If, on the date fixed for redemption, cash necessary for the redemption shall be
available for such purpose and

-6-
<PAGE>

irrecoverably shall have been deposited or set apart, then, notwithstanding that
the certificates evidencing any shares so called for redemption shall not have
been surrendered, the dividends with respect to the shares so called shall cease
to accrue after the date fixed for redemption, the shares no longer shall be
deemed outstanding, the holders thereof shall cease to be holders of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, and all rights whatsoever with respect to the
shares so called for redemption (except the right of the holders to receive
payment of the Redemption Price as herein provided, without interest, upon
surrender of their certificates therefor) shall terminate. Any cash necessary
for the redemption of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to be available therefor for purposes of the preceding sentence and for
purposes of Section 7, if, on or before the date fixed for redemption, the
Company shall deposit with a bank or trust company that has an office in the
Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, and that has, or is an affiliate of a
bank that has, a capital surplus of at least $50,000,000, the cash necessary for
such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be
applied to the redemption of the shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock and any Parity Dividend Stock so called for redemption. No interest shall
accrue for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any cash so set apart by the Corporation.
Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of six
years from the redemption date shall revert to the general funds of the
Corporation, after which reversion the holders of such shares so called for
redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Corporation for the
payment of such cash.

The holder of any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
redeemed upon any exercise of the Corporation's redemption right shall not be
entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price for such shares until such
holder shall cause to be delivered to the place specified in the notice given
with respect to such redemption (i) the certificate or certificates representing
such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock redeemed and (ii) transfer
instruments satisfactory to the Corporation and sufficient to transfer such
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to the Corporation free of any
adverse interest. No interest shall accrue on the Redemption Price of any share
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock after its redemption date.

In the event that any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
shall be converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 5, then (i) the
Corporation shall not have the right to redeem such shares and (ii) any funds
which shall have been deposited for the payment of the Redemption Price for such
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be returned to the
Corporation immediately after such conversion (subject to declared dividends
payable to holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on the
record date for such

-7-
<PAGE>

dividends, to the extent set forth in Section 5 hereof, regardless of whether
such shares are converted subsequent to such record date and prior to the
related Dividend Payment Date).

(c) Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares. No fractional shares
------------------------------------------ 
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be issued upon any redemption of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, but, in lieu thereof, the Corporation
shall pay to the holder of such shares an appropriate amount in cash (computed
to the nearest cent) based on the value of the shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of
Directors.

(5) Conversion.
---------- 

(a) Right of Conversion. Subject to and upon compliance with the
------------------- 
provisions of this Section 5, each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
shall, at the option of the holder thereof, be convertible at any time (unless
such share is called for redemption, then to and including but not after 5:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the date fixed for such redemption, unless the
Corporation shall default in payment due upon redemption thereof), into that
number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (calculated as to
each conversion to the nearest 1/100th of a share) obtained by dividing $50.00
by the Conversion Price (as defined in Section 5(d)) in effect at such time and
by surrender of such share so to be converted in the manner provided in Section
5(b).

(b) Manner of Exercise of Conversion Privilege. In order to exercise
------------------------------------------ 
the conversion privilege, the holder of one or more shares of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted shall surrender such shares at any
of the offices or agencies to be maintained for such purpose by the Corporation
accompanied by the funds, if any, required by the last paragraph of this Section
5(b) and shall give written notice of conversion in the form provided on such
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (or such other notice as is
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation) to the Corporation at such office or
agency that the holder elects to convert the shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock specified in said notice. Such notice shall also state the name
or names, together with address or addresses, in which the certificate or
certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable on such
conversion shall be issued. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
surrendered for conversion, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be
issued in the same name as the name in which such share of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock is registered, shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer,
in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the holder or such
holder's duly authorized attorney. As promptly as practicable after the
surrender of such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the receipt
of such notice, instruments of transfer and funds, if any, as aforesaid, the

-8-
<PAGE>

Corporation shall issue and shall deliver at such office or agency to such
holder, or on his written order, a certificate or certificates for the number of
full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such shares of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 5 and a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest in a share
of Common Stock arising upon such conversion, as provided in Section 5(c).

Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected immediately
prior to the close of business on the business day following the date on which
such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall have been surrendered
and such notice (and any applicable instruments of transfer and any required
taxes) received by the Corporation as aforesaid, and the person or persons in
whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock
shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder
or holders of record of the shares represented thereby at such time on such
date, and such conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in effect at such
time on such date, unless the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall be
closed on that date, in which event such person or persons shall be deemed to
have become such holder or holders of record at the close of business on the
next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, and such
conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in effect on the close of business
on such next succeeding business day upon which such shares of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock shall have been surrendered and such notice received
by the Corporation.

Any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock surrendered for
conversion during the period from the close of business on the record date for
any dividend payment to the opening of business on the related Dividend Payment
Date (unless such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall have been
called for redemption on a date in such period) shall be accompanied by payment,
in funds acceptable to the Corporation, of an amount equal to the dividend
otherwise payable on such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided for above
in this Section, no adjustment shall be made for dividends accrued on any shares
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock converted or for dividends on any shares
issued upon the conversion of such shares as provided in this Section.

(c) Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or 
------------------------------------------ 
scrip representing fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversion of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. If more than one share of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one
time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate of $50.00 for
each such share so surrendered. In lieu of any fractional interest in a share of

-9-
<PAGE>

Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon the conversion of any
share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay to the
holder of such shares an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to
the average Closing Price per share of Common Stock as calculated for the ten
day trading period ending on the fifth trading day prior to the day of
conversion multiplied by the fractional interest in a share of Common Stock that
otherwise would have been deliverable upon conversion of such share.

(d) Adjustment of Conversion Price. The "Conversion Price" shall mean and
------------------------------ 
be $8.25, subject to adjustment from time to time by the Corporation as follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall (A) pay a dividend or make a
distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock (other than
pursuant to a dividend reinvestment or similar plan), (B) subdivide its
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (C)
combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, or (D) issue by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of
capital stock of the Corporation, then in each such case the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the
holder of any share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock thereafter
surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares
of Common Stock or other capital stock of the Corporation which he would have
owned or been entitled to receive immediately following such action had such
share been converted immediately prior to the occurrence of such event. An
adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (i) shall become effective
immediately after the record date, in the case of a dividend or distribution,
or immediately after the effective date, in the case of a subdivision,
combination or reclassification.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall issue rights, options or warrants
to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less
than the current market price per share (as determined pursuant to subsection
(iv) of this Section 5(d)) of the Common Stock (other than pursuant to any
stock option, restricted stock or other incentive or benefit plan or stock
ownership or purchase plan for the benefit of employees, directors or
officers or any dividend reinvestment plan of the Corporation in effect at
the time hereof or any other similar plan adopted or implemented hereafter),
then with respect to any conversion prior to the expiration of such rights,
options or warrants, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto
shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying
the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of issuance of
such rights, options or warrants by a fraction of which the

-10-
<PAGE>

numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
date of issuance of such rights, options or warrants (immediately prior to
such issuance) plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price
of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such current
market price, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options or
warrants (immediately prior to such issuance) plus the number of additional
shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase. Such adjustment
shall be made successively whenever any rights, options or warrants are
issued, and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or
warrants; provided, however, in the event that all the shares of Common Stock
offered for subscription or purchase are not delivered upon the exercise of
such rights, options or warrants, upon the expiration of such rights, options
or warrants the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price
which would have been in effect had the numerator and the denominator of the
foregoing fraction and the resulting adjustment been made based upon the
number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered upon the exercise of such
rights, options or warrants rather than upon the number of shares of Common
Stock offered for subscription or purchase. In determining whether any
rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock at less than such current market price, and in
determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock,
there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the
Corporation for such rights, options or warrants, the value of such
consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (whose reasonable determination
shall be conclusive, except for arithmetic errors, and shall be described in
a statement filed by the Corporation with the stock transfer agent).

(iii) In case the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise,
distribute to all holders of its outstanding Common Stock, evidences of its
indebtedness or assets (including securities and cash, but excluding any cash
dividend of the Corporation paid out of retained earnings and dividends or
distributions payable in stock pursuant to a dividend reinvestment or similar
plan or for which adjustment is made pursuant to subsection (i) of this
Section 5(d)) or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
securities of the Corporation (excluding those referred to in subsection (ii)
of this Section 5(d)), then in each such case the Conversion Price shall be
adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the record date of such
distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market
price per

-11-
<PAGE>

share of the Common Stock as determined pursuant to subsection (iv) of this
Section 5(d) less the fair market value on such record date (as determined by
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose
reasonable determination shall be conclusive, except for arithmetic errors,
and shall be described in a statement filed by the Corporation with the stock
transfer agent) of the portion of the capital stock or assets or the
evidences of indebtedness or assets so distributed to the holder of one share
of Common Stock or of such subscription rights, options or warrants
applicable to one share of Common Stock, and of which the denominator shall
be such current market price per share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall
become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.

(iv) For the purpose of any computation under subsections (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 5(d), the current market price per share of Common
Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the Closing Price for
the shorter of (A) 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last full
trading day prior to the Time of Determination or (B) the period commencing
on the date next succeeding the first public announcement of the issuance of
such rights, options or warrants or such distribution through such last full
trading day prior to the Time of Determination. For purposes of the
foregoing, the term "Time of Determination" shall mean the time and date of
the earlier of (I) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
receive the rights, options, warrants or distributions referred to in Section
5(d) (ii) and (iii) or (II) the commencement of "ex-dividend" trading on the
New York Stock Exchange or such other United States exchange or market on
which the Common Stock of the Corporation is then listed or admitted for
trading.

(v) In any case in which this Section 5(d) shall require that an
adjustment be made immediately following a record date or an effective date,
the Corporation may elect to defer (but only until the filing by the
Corporation with the stock transfer agent of the certificate required by
subsection (vii) of this Section 5(d)) issuing to the holder of any share of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock converted after such record date or
effective date the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion over
and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion on the
basis of the Conversion Price prior to adjustment, and paying to such holder
any amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share.

(vi) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required to be
made unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least
1% of such price;

-12-
<PAGE>

provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection
(vi) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into
account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section
5(d) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share,
as the case may be. Anything in this Section 5(d) to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Corporation shall be entitled to make such reduction in
the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this Section 5(d), as
it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any stock
dividend, subdivision of shares, distribution of rights to purchase stock or
securities, or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable
for stock hereafter made by the Corporation to its stockholders shall not be
taxable to the recipients. Except as set forth in subsections (i), (ii) and
(iii) above, the Conversion Price shall not be adjusted for any such event
including, without limitation, the issuance of Common Stock, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the
right to purchase any of the foregoing, in exchange for cash, property or
services.

(vii) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided,
(A) the Corporation promptly shall file with the stock transfer agent a
certificate setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and a
brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and the manner of
computing the same, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the
correctness of such adjustment, except for arithmetic errors, and (B) the
Corporation also shall deliver or mail, or cause to be delivered or mailed by
first class mail, postage prepaid, as soon as practicable to each holder of
record of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock a notice stating
that the Conversion Price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted
Conversion Price. The stock transfer agent shall not be under any duty or
responsibility with respect to the certificate required by this subsection
(vii) except to exhibit the same to any holder of shares of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock who requests to inspect it.

(viii) In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment
made pursuant to subsection (i) of this Section 5(d), the holder of any share
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion
shall become entitled to receive any shares of the Corporation other than
shares of Common Stock, thereafter the Conversion Price of such other shares
so receivable upon conversion of any share of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on
terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to
Common Stock contained in this Section.

-13-
<PAGE>

(ix) The Corporation from time to time may decrease the Conversion
Price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days
and if the decrease is irrevocable during the period. Whenever the Conversion
Price is so decreased, the Corporation shall deliver or mail to holders of
record of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock a notice of the
decrease at least 15 days before the date the decreased Conversion Price
takes effect, and such notice shall state the decreased Conversion Price and
the period it will be in effect.

(e) Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Corporate Actions. In case:
---------------------------------------------------- 

(i) the Corporation shall take any action which would require an
adjustment in the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 5(d)(iii); or

(ii) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to the holders of
its Common Stock generally of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase any shares of stock of any class or of any other rights; or

(iii) there shall be any reorganization or reclassification of the
Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding
Common Stock and other than a change in the par value of the Common Stock),
or any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party or any
statutory exchange of securities with another corporation and for which
approval of any stockholders of the Corporation is required, or any sale,
lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or

(iv) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up of the Corporation;

then in each such case the Corporation shall cause to be delivered or mailed by
first class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of shares of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock and the stock transfer agent, as promptly as
possible, but in any event at least 20 days prior to the applicable date
hereinafter specified, a written notice stating (i) the date on which a record
is to be taken for the purpose of such action or granting of rights, options or
warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders
of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such distribution, rights, options
or warrants are to be determined, or (ii) the date on which such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, statutory exchange, sale, lease,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective
or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock
of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for
securities, cash or other property

-14-
<PAGE>

deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger,
statutory exchange, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-
up. Failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the
legality or validity or the proceedings described in subsection (i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) of this Section 5(e).

(f) Reservation of Shares of Common Stock. The Corporation covenants
------------------------------------- 
that it will, at all times, reserve and keep available, free from preemptive
rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock for the purpose of effecting conversions of shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock not
theretofore converted and on or before (and as a condition of) taking any action
that would cause an adjustment of the Conversion Price resulting in an increase
in the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion above the
number thereof previously reserved and available therefor, the Corporation shall
take all such action so required. For purposes of this Section 5(f), the number
of shares of Common Stock which shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed as
if at the time of computation all outstanding shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock were held by a single holder.

Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the
Conversion Price below the then par value (if any) of the shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock, the Corporation shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion
of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and
legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at such
adjusted Conversion Price.

(g) Transfer Taxes, Etc. The Corporation shall pay any and all
-------------------- 
documentary stamp, issue or transfer taxes, and any other similar taxes payable
in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided,
however, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be
payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares
of Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the shares of Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted and no such issue or delivery
shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has
paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

(h) Consolidation or Merger or Sale of Assets. Notwithstanding any
----------------------------------------- 
other provision herein to the contrary, in

-15-
<PAGE>

case of any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party (other
than a merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is the continuing
corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, or the securities or other
property of another corporation), or in case of any sale, lease or transfer to
another corporation of the property of the Corporation as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, then lawful provision shall be made by the
corporation formed by such consolidation or the corporation whose securities,
cash or other property immediately after the merger or consolidation will be
owned, by virtue of the merger or consolidation, by the holders of Common Stock
immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, or the corporation which shall
have acquired such assets or securities of the Corporation (collectively the
"Formed, Surviving or Acquiring Corporation"), as the case may be, providing
that the holder of each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall have the right thereafter to convert such share into the kind
and amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such
consolidation, merger, sale, lease or transfer by a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger,
sale, lease or transfer assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise
his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or
other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or
transfer (provided that, if the kind or amount of securities, cash or other
property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or transfer is
not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of
election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the
purposes of this Section 5(h) the kind and amount of securities, cash or other
property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or transfer for
each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable
per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). The Formed, Surviving or
Acquiring Corporation, as the case may be, shall make provision in its
certificate or articles of incorporation or other constituent documents to the
end that the provisions set forth in this Section 5(h) shall thereafter
correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, in relation
to any shares of stock or other securities or property thereafter deliverable on
the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.

The above provisions of this Section 5(h) shall similarly apply to
successive consolidations, mergers, sales, leases or transfers.

(i) Covenant as to Common Stock. The Corporation covenants that all
--------------------------- 
shares of Common Stock which may be delivered upon conversions of shares of
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will upon delivery be duly and validly
issued and fully

-16-
<PAGE>

paid and nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any
preemptive rights.

The Corporation will list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock
shall be listed on The New York Stock Exchange, all Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.

(6) Voting Rights.
------------- 

(a) General. The holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
------- 
shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from
time to time required by law. In connection with any right to vote, each holder
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will have one vote for each share held.
Any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Corporation or
any entity controlled by the Corporation shall not have voting rights hereunder
and shall not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum.

(b) Default Voting Rights. Whenever dividends on the Series B
--------------------- 
Convertible Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to at least
six quarterly dividend payments (whether or not consecutive), (i) the number of
members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two,
effective as of the time of election of such directors as hereinafter provided,
and (ii) the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (voting as a
class together with all other affected classes or series of the Parity Dividend
Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable
(other than the Series A Preferred Stock)) will have the exclusive right to vote
for and elect such two additional directors of the Corporation at any meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation at which directors are to be elected held during
the period such dividends remain in arrears. The right of the holders of the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to vote for such two additional directors
shall terminate when all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or set apart for
payment. The term of office of all directors so elected shall terminate
immediately upon the termination of the right of the holders of the Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock and such Parity Dividend Stock to vote for such two
additional directors.

The foregoing right of the holders of the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock with respect to the election of two directors may be exercised
at any annual meeting of stockholders or at any special meeting of stockholders
held for such purpose. If the right to elect directors shall have accrued to the
holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock more than 90 days preceding
the date established for the next annual meeting of stockholders, the President
of the Corporation shall, within 20 days after the delivery to the Corporation
at its principal office of a written request for a special meeting signed by the

-17-
<PAGE>

holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock then outstanding, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock to be held within 60 days after the delivery of such
request for the purpose of electing such additional directors.

The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and any such
Parity Dividend Stock referred to above (excluding the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock) voting together shall have the right to remove without cause at
any time and replace any directors such holders have elected pursuant to this
Section 6.

(c) Class Voting Rights. So long as the Series B Convertible
------------------- 
Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of all
outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (unless the vote or
consent of a greater percentage is required by applicable law or the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation), voting separately
as a class, (i) amend, alter or repeal (by merger, consolidation or otherwise)
any provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the
Bylaws of the Corporation, as amended, so as to affect adversely the relative
rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) authorize or issue, or increase the authorized
amount of, any additional class or series of stock, or any security convertible
into stock of such class or series, ranking prior to the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock in respect of the payment of dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or (iii) effect any
reclassification of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. A class vote on
the part of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, without limitation,
specifically shall not be deemed to be required (except as otherwise required by
law or resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation) in connection
with: (a) the authorization, issuance or increase in the authorized amount of
any shares of any other class or series of stock that ranks junior to, or on a
parity with, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of the payment
of dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;
or (b) the authorization, issuance or increase in the amount of any notes,
bonds, mortgages, debentures or other obligations of the Corporation not
convertible into or exchangeable, directly or indirectly, for stock ranking
prior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of the payment of
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

(7) Outstanding Shares. For purposes of this Certificate of Designations,
------------------ 
all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be deemed outstanding
except (i) from the date fixed for redemption pursuant to Section 4, all shares
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that have been so called for

-18-
<PAGE>

redemption under Section 4 if the cash necessary for payment of the Redemption
Price irrevocably has been set aside; (ii) from the date of surrender of
certificates representing shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, all
shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock; and
(iii) from the date of registration of transfer, all shares of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock held of record by the Corporation or any subsidiary
of the Corporation.

(8) No Other Rights and Powers. The shares of Series B Convertible
-------------------------- 
Preferred Stock shall not have any relative, participating, optional or other
special rights and powers other than as set forth herein.

(9) Preemptive Rights. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is not
----------------- 
entitled to any preemptive or subscription rights in respect of any securities
of the Corporation.

(10) Severability of Provisions. Whenever possible, each provision hereof
-------------------------- 
shall be interpreted in a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision hereof is held to be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating or otherwise adversely affecting
the remaining provisions hereof. If a court of competent jurisdiction should
determine that a provision hereof would be valid or enforceable if a period of
time were extended or shortened or a particular percentage were increased or
decreased, then such court may make such change as shall be necessary to render
the provision in question effective and valid under applicable law.

"FURTHER RESOLVED, that each officer of the Corporation hereby is
authorized, in the name and on behalf of the Corporation, to prepare, execute,
seal and file, or cause to be prepared, executed, sealed and filed, the
Certificate of Designations relating to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock

ARTICLE 9
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND INDEMNITY
----------------------------------

9.1 Right to Specific Performance of Obligations. AGI hereby acknowledges
-------------------------------------------- 
that default in making the payments or tabling the instruments set out in
sections 8.3(a) and (c) would constitute an injury and damage to Bema difficult
to measure monetarily and, in the event of any such failure, provided the Final
Closing Conditions in Sections 8.4(c), (d), (e) and (f) have been met or waived
by the applicable parties, Bema shall, in addition and without prejudice to any
other rights and remedies at law or in equity which it may have, be entitled to
pursue the remedy of specific performance without any undertaking as to damages
and AGI hereby waives any right to require that security be posted in connection
therewith.

9.2 Remedy of Specific Performance Assignable. Due to the structure of
----------------------------------------- 
the Transactions, AGI further acknowledges that, provided the Final Closing
Conditions set out in Sections 8.4(c), (d), (e) and (f) have been met, default
by AGI to table the payments or instruments set out in sections 8.3(a) and (c)
would constitute an injury and damage to CMR for which CMR would have no
direct remedy enforceable against AGI. AGI hereby agrees that Bema may assign
to CMR Bema's right to cause AGI to specifically perform its obligations under
sections 8.3(a) and (c).
<PAGE>

- 32 -

9.3 Indemnity. AGI hereby agrees that it shall indemnify and hold
--------- 
harmless Bema and its Affiliates from any and all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, costs or expenses (including all fees and disbursements of legal
counsel) incurred or suffered by Bema or its Affiliates in connection with or
arising out of default by AGI to table the payments or instruments set out in
sections 8.3(a) and (c), including any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
costs or expenses incurred or suffered by Bema or its Affiliates as a result of
litigation or arbitration proceedings brought by CMR against CMM pursuant to the
.

If any action, suit or proceeding is commenced against Bema or its Affiliates,
or any written claim or demand against Bema or its Affiliates is received by
them in respect of which Bema and its Affiliates proposes to demand
indemnification by AGI pursuant to the provisions of this Article 9, AGI shall
be notified to that effect with reasonable promptness and no later than 10 days,
and, provided that AGI acknowledges and accepts liability vis-a-vis Bema or its
Affiliates in respect of such claims, AGI shall have the right, by notifying
Bema with reasonable promptness and no later than 10 days after AGI has received
notice from Bema, to assume the entire control of the defense, compromise or
settlement of the matter provided any compromise or settlement does not contain
any admission of liability or fault on the part of Bema or its Affiliates
(subject to the right of Bema to participate, at their expense and with counsel
of its choice), including employment of counsel of AGI's choice and at its own
expense, and, in connection therewith, provided that AGI pays all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by Bema and its Affiliates in doing so, Bema and its
Affiliates shall cooperate in every reasonable manner and make available to AGI
all pertinent information under their control.

If, in its discretion, Bema at any time deems it necessary or desirable to
compromise or settle any action, suit, proceeding, claim or demand with respect
to which AGI has notified Bema that AGI will assume control of the defense,
compromise or settlement of the matter, Bema may so proceed without consent of
AGI, and in that event, AGI shall have no obligation to indemnify Bema relating
to any matter so compromised or settled.

9.4 Termination. This provisions of this Article 9 shall expire upon
----------- 
completion of the Final Closing.

Section 2.1 General Statement of Intent. The Shareholders
---------------------------
unanimously agree that, among other things, this Agreement sets forth the
unanimous agreement of the Shareholders referred to in Articles 6, 32, 33 and
35 of the Bylaws. The Shareholders further unanimously agree that this
Agreement shall constitute the irrevocable unanimous agreement of the
Shareholders with respect to such matters and all other matters which are the

agree otherwise, and that no further action by the Shareholders shall be
necessary or appropriate to achieve or effect the unanimous agreement
referred to in such articles of the Bylaws.

Section 2.2 Controlling Terms. In the event of any inconsistency
-----------------
between the terms and conditions of the Bylaws and the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

<PAGE>
Section 2.4 Financing of Project Construction.
---------------------------------

A. The Shareholders have approved the following general plan
for funding the Operations necessary to achieve Completion of Construction
(the "Financing Plan"):

Source of Funds Approximate Amount
--------------- ------------------

Gold/Dollar Loan US$75-80 million
Equipment Financing US$25-30 million
Equity/Junior Subordinated Debt US$15-25 million

The Shareholders shall jointly seek, on the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Section 2.4, Project Financing (hereinafter defined) for the
Company. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.4, the
Shareholders each shall use, for a period of 18 months from and after the
date of this Agreement, commercially reasonable, good faith efforts to secure:
(i) firm written commitments to provide on commercially reasonable terms the
Gold/Dollar Loan and Equipment Financing components (the Gold/Dollar Loan
and Equipment Financing components shall be referred to collectively as
"Project Financing") of the Financing Plan for the Company, provided,
however that each Shareholder shall be responsible only for its share of the
costs necessary to achieve Completion of Construction, and only for a
corresponding share of Project Financing, and (ii) the funds necessary for its
share of the Equity/Junior Subordinated Debt component of the Financing
Plan. Each of the Shareholders acknowledges that the amount of the
Equity/Junior Subordinated Debt component of the Financing Plan which it
may contribute to the Company in the form of subordinated debt is limited by
the Investment Contract and, subject to the provisions of this Section 2.4,
agrees to cause the conversion of any contribution it has made to the
Company in the form of subordinated debt to equity if such action is required
to obtain Project Financing and to comply with DL600. It shall be a condition
of Project Financing that a default by either Shareholder or any guarantor of
the obligations of such Shareholder with respect to Project Financing shall not
constitute a default by the other Shareholder or any guarantor of the
obligations such other Shareholder with respect to Project Financing.

B. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.4, AGI
and Bema shall, for the 18 month period described in Section 2.4A of this
Agreement, use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to assist its
subsidiary identified in Section 2.4A with respect to the undertakings
contained in that Section. If requested by a lender offering to provide
Project Financing, AGI and Bema shall each agree to provide a corporate
guarantee, as a parent company, solely for its subsidiary's share of Project
Financing, with such guarantee to be effective only until the relevant
operational and economic completion tests incorporated in the Project
Financing Documents are satisfied. If hedging is required in conjunction with
Project Financing, AGI will undertake its share for its own account, and Bema
will provide a put program back-up as required. At Bema's request, AGI will
assist Bema in the put program and counterparty facilities to reduce Bema's
costs, but AGI will not be required to act as a counterparty or to assume any
liabilities or costs in connection therewith.

-10-
<PAGE>
C. Nothing in this Agreement, in the Bylaws or in the Project
Agreement shall require either AGI, any affiliate of AGI, Bema or any of its
Affiliates (i) to seek to obtain Project Financing on terms which if accepted
would, or to accept Project Financing which would, impair or preclude its
ability to finance or to operate other projects or properties it now owns or
hereafter acquires, or (ii) to seek to obtain or to use existing cash, lines of
credit, credit facilities or any other source or potential source of funds to
provide the Equity/Junior Debt component of the Financing Plan, if such
action would impair or preclude its ability to finance or to operate other
projects or properties it now owns or hereafter acquires. Neither Shareholder
shall have a fiduciary duty with respect to the other Shareholder or such
Shareholder's parent corporation with respect to any obligation arising under
Section 2.4 of this Agreement. Neither AGI nor Bema shall have a fiduciary
duty with respect to the other or the other's subsidiary corporation with
respect to any obligation arising under Section 2.4 of this Agreement.

D. The Shareholders, AGI and Bema shall cooperate in seeking to
obtain Project Financing in discharge of their obligations under Sections 2.4A
and 2.4B of this Agreement. Each of the Shareholders, AGI and Bema shall
bear all costs, expenses and fees it incurs in attempting to secure Project
Financing and in attempting to secure the Equity/Junior Subordinated Debt
component of the Financing Plan, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the other Shareholder, and its Affiliates from any claim for any such
cost, expense or fee; provided, however, that all fees, charges and costs
(including attorneys and technical consultants fees) paid to the banks,
insurance companies, equipment suppliers or other entities which provide
Project Financing which is accepted by both Shareholders shall be borne
jointly by the Shareholders in proportion to their Ownership Interests
through the Company.

E. Except as provided in Section 2.5 of this Agreement, or the
Shareholders otherwise agree, Development of the Refugio Project Properties,
other than to the extent provided in the Initial Program and Budget, will not
commence until written commitments acceptable to both Shareholders for
Project Financing have been obtained and each Shareholder is able to
contribute to the Company the Equity/Junior Subordinated Debt component of
the Financing Plan.

Section 2.5 Unilateral Right to Proceed With Project Construction
-----------------------------------------------------
and Subsequent Operations.
- --------------------------

A. If upon the expiration of the 18 month period described in
Section 2.4A of this Agreement, either of the Shareholders has not obtained
and accepted a written commitment for Project Financing and/or is unable to
contribute the Equity/Junior Subordinated Debt component of the Financing
Plan, then notwithstanding Section 2.4E or any other provision of this
Agreement, either Shareholder (the "Notifying Shareholder") may elect to
proceed with Development and Mining of the Refugio Project Properties in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, upon providing written
notice of its election to do so to the other Shareholder (the "Notified
Shareholder") (with the first such notice given to control). The notice shall
identify the project to be undertaken in reasonable detail, and shall identify
any material differences between the project proposed by the

-11-
<PAGE>
Notifying Shareholder and the project contemplated by the Project Feasibility 
Study. Any project proposed pursuant to this Section 2.5A shall contemplate the
production of at least 100,000 ounces of gold per year. The notice shall be
accompanied by a budget for the Project Construction of the proposed project.
A Notified Shareholder shall, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, elect
one of the options specified below in this Section 2.5A and advise the
Notifying Shareholder which such option it has elected; provided, however that
if the proposed project differs materially from the project contemplated by the
Project Feasibility Study, the Notified Party shall have 90 days in which to
respond to any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.5A; and provided
further that such notice may be given during the last 90 days of the 18
month period described in Section 2.4A. The Notified Shareholder shall, within
30 days after receipt of a notice given pursuant to this section 2.5A:

(1) Commit to fund its proportionate share of all costs of
Project Construction of the proposed project from its own sources (including
its own borrowings); or

(2) Request from the Notifying Shareholder a credit
facility from which one or more loans (a "Project Construction Loan") shall be
made for all or a specified portion of the Notified Shareholder's proportionate
share of all costs for Project Construction of the proposed project; or

(3) Convert all of its Shares to Series C Shares which shall
entitle it to receive only 10% of the Net Profits thereafter generated by the
Company as provided in Exhibit F, upon which conversion the Notified
Shareholder shall have no Ownership Interest in, or any rights with respect
to, the Company or the Refugio Project Properties except as provided in
Exhibit F and in Section 2.5E.

If the Notified Shareholder does not timely elect one of the options specified
in Sections 2.5A(1), 2.5A(2) or 2.5A(3), it will be deemed irrevocably to have
elected the option specified in Section 2.5A(3).

B. The credit facility described in Section 11.2 shall not be
available to the Notified Shareholder. However, the provisions of Section 11.3
shall apply to a Notified Shareholder that has elected the option specified in
Sections 2.5A(1) or 2.5A(2).

C. If the Notified Shareholder elects the option specified in
Section 2.5A(1), the Board shall be deemed to have adopted the proposed
project and accompanying budget for Project Construction as an Approved
Program and Budget and the Notified Shareholder shall be deemed to have
elected to participate therein to the full extent of its Ownership Interest.

D. If the Notified Shareholder elects the option specified in
Section 2.5A(2):

(1) It shall be responsible for providing any funds for
Project Construction not included within the requested credit facility, subject
to the provisions of Section 11.3.

-12-
<PAGE>
(2) The Board shall be deemed to have adopted the
proposed project and accompanying budget for Project Construction as an
Approved Program and Budget and the Notified Shareholder shall be deemed to
have elected to participate therein to the full extent of its Ownership 
Interest.

(3) The Notifying Shareholder shall have with respect to
the requested credit facility the rights specified in Section 11.4 of this
Agreement; and if a credit facility is extended to the Notified Shareholder, any
Project Construction Loan made pursuant thereto shall be made in accordance
with and subject to Sections 11.4 and 11.5 of this Agreement.

E. If the Notified Shareholder elects the option specified in
Section 2.5A(3), it shall have the right to repurchase an Ownership Interest
equal to the Ownership Interest it held immediately prior to the time of such
election. To exercise such repurchase right, the Notified Shareholder shall
give written notice of its election to the Notifying Shareholder within 90 days
after Completion of Construction of the proposed project, which notice must be
accompanied by a payment to the Notifying Shareholder, in immediately
available funds, in an amount equal to:

(1) 150% of the product obtained by multiplying:

(a) all costs of every kind and character incurred or
accrued by the Notifying Shareholder, from and after the date of the Notified
Shareholder's election under Section 2.5A(3), for or in connection with the
ownership or Development of the Refugio Project Properties, including without
limitation all costs for Project Construction, by

(b) the Ownership Interest transferred to the
Notifying Shareholder by the Notified Shareholder on the date of its election
under Section 2.5A(3) divided by one hundred; plus

(2) an amount equivalent to interest on all costs described
in Section 2.5E(1)(a) at the Effective Interest Rate from the time the Notifying
Shareholder incurred or accrued such costs until payment is made to the
Notifying Shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.5E.

To exercise the repurchase option provided in this Section 2.5E, the Notified
Shareholder shall also expressly assume in writing, by execution of one or
more documents in form and substance satisfactory to the Notifying
Shareholder, a share equal to its reacquired Ownership Interest of all
liabilities and obligations of the Company and all liabilities and obligations
incurred by the Notifying Shareholder with respect to the Company or the
Refugio Project Properties from and after the date of the Notified
Shareholder's election pursuant to Section 2.5A(3). Upon full compliance with
this Section 2.5E by the Notified Shareholder, including payment of the
amounts specified herein, the Notifying Shareholder shall cause the Company
to convert the Series C Shares held by the Notified Shareholder to the same
number and Series of Shares held by the Notified Shareholder immediately
prior to its election of the option provided in Section 2.5A(3). For purposes
of the formula in Section 4.5 of this Agreement, the Notified Shareholder will
thereafter be deemed to have contributed to the

-13-
<PAGE>
Company an amount equal to 100% of the costs described in Section 2.5E(1)(a)
multiplied by the Ownership Interest equivalent to the Shares it reacquired
pursuant to this Section 2.5E, divided by 100.

F. If the Notified Shareholder has elected the option specified in
Section 2.5A(2) or 2.5A(3), and the Notifying Shareholder does not obtain
commitments for financing of Project Construction for the project described in
the notice given pursuant to Section 2.5A or a substantially similar project
within 6 months after the date of the Notified Shareholder's election and does
not award one or more contracts for Project Construction totalling at least
U.S. $1 million within 18 months after the date of the Notified Shareholder's
election and does not commence Project Construction of such a project within
such 18 month period, then upon the expiration of the relevant period:

(1) the election made by the Notified Shareholder shall be
deemed rescinded;

(2) the Notified Shareholder shall pay to the Notifying
Shareholder an amount equal to the sum of all costs (including capital
costs) which the Notifying Shareholder incurred from and after the date
of the Notified Shareholder's election for the maintenance of the Refugio
Project Properties, multiplied by its Ownership Interest immediately
prior to its election, divided by 100; and

(3) either Shareholder shall thereafter have the right to
elect to act as a Notifying Shareholder under this Section 2.5.

For purposes of this Section 2.5F, Project Construction shall be deemed to
commence upon mobilization of equipment and commencement of excavation of
the heap leach pad facility contemplated by the proposed project.

Section 2.6 Investment Contract. Each Shareholder shall, at all
-------------------
times, comply with its obligations under and take all actions necessary to
maintain in good standing the Investment Contract. Each Sharheolder shall at all
time maintain as equity at least 15% of the funds it or its Affiliates invest in
the Company under the Investment Contract. Neither Shareholder shall, without
the express consent of the other, make or seek to make any change in the
Investment Contract that would adversely affect the other Shareholder, the

Shareholder to maintain its investment in the Company under 11 bis of DL600 or

---------
in the Bylaws shall be deemed to constitute any Shareholder the partner or
joint venturer of the other, to create any fiduciary relationship between them,
nor, except as otherwise herein expressly provided, to constitute any
Shareholder the agent or legal representative of any other. It is not the
intention of the Shareholders to create, nor shall this Agreement be construed
to create, any mining, commercial, or other partnership or joint venture. No
Shareholder shall have any authority to act for or to assume any obligation or
responsibility on behalf of any other Shareholder in its individual capacity,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein. Each Shareholder shall

implied, of the General Manager or of any director, officer or committee of the
Company.

respect to the Refugio Project Properties or as expressly provided in the
Bylaws or this Agreement, each Shareholder and its Affiliates shall have the
right independently to engage in and receive full benefits from business

act or omission resulting in loss or damages to the Company or to the other
Shareholder, except as provided in Sections 3.2 or 3.8 of this Agreement.

Section 3.7 No Fiduciary Duties. The directors of the Company
-------------------
are responsible to, and bound to represent the interests of, the Shareholder

for a director of the Company in discharging his or her responsibilities under
the Bylaws or this Agreement, whether as a member of the Board or the
Technical Management Committee, to place the interests of the Shareholder that

OWNERSHIP INTERESTS
-------------------

Section 4.1 Ownership Interests of Shareholders. The Ownership
-----------------------------------
Interest of each Shareholder is the equitable and beneficial ownership right
and interest of the Shareholder in the Company. The Ownership Interests of
the Shareholders shall be adjusted as provided in this Agreement. On the
date of this Agreement AGRI has a 50% Ownership Interest and Bema Bermuda
has a 50% Ownership Interest.

Section 4.2 Ownership of Shares to Correspond to Ownership Interests. 
--------------------------------------------------------
Each of the existing Shares of the Company represents a one-hundredth of one
percent (0.01%) Ownership Interest. The Shares of the Company shall be held by
each of the Shareholders in proportion to its Ownership Interest. On the date of
this Agreement, Bema Bermuda holds 5,000 Series A Shares, corresponding to its
50% Ownership Interest, and AGRI owns 5,000 Series B Shares, corresponding to
its 50% Ownership Interest.

Section 4.3 Changes in Ownership Interests. A Shareholder's
------------------------------
Ownership Interest shall be changed as follows:

A. Upon an election by a Shareholder pursuant to Section 4.5
of this Agreement to contribute less to an Adopted Program and Budget than
the amount corresponding to its Ownership Interest.

B. As provided in Sections 2.5 or 4.6 of this Agreement.

C. If a Shareholder defaults in making its agreed upon
contribution to an Adopted Program and Budget or with respect to a Default
Loan made pursuant to Section 10.3A, followed by an election by the other
Shareholder to invoke the provisions of Section 10.3B of this Agreement.

D. If the Series A Shareholder defaults with respect to an
Initial Program Loan.

E. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.4, in the event of an
uncured condition of default by a Shareholder or its guarantor under any of
the Project Financing Documents followed by an election by the other
Shareholder to invoke the provisions of Section 10.3B of this Agreement. As
used in the immediately preceding sentence, "uncured

-17-
<PAGE>

condition of default" shall mean any default under the Project Financing
Documents or any condition which with the passing of time, the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute a default under the Project Financing Documents, which
is not cured prior to one business day before the expiration of the applicable
period for cure under the Project Financing Documents.

F. By transfer by a Shareholder of less than all of its Shares
in accordance with Article 16 of this Agreement.

G. By acquisition of the Shares of the other Shareholder,
however arising.

Section 4.4 Changes in Ownership of Shares. If the Ownership
------------------------------
Interests of the Shareholders are changed, the ownership of the Shares of the
Company shall also be changed to correspond to the changed Ownership
Interests. For example, assume that all of the Series B Shares are held by
one Shareholder (the "Reducing Shareholder"), and that all of the Series A
Shares are held by another Shareholder (the "Increasing Shareholder").
Assume further that, pursuant to Section 4.5 of this Agreement, the Ownership
Interest of the Reducing Shareholder was reduced from 50% to 40% (and that
the Ownership Interest of the Increasing Shareholder was thus increased to
60%). Pursuant to Section 4.7 of this Agreement, 1000 Series B Shares would
be transferred from the Reducing Shareholder to the Increasing Shareholder,
with the result that the Reducing Shareholder would own 4,000 Series B
Shares and the Increasing Shareholder would own a total of 6,000 Shares
(5,000 Shares of Series A and 1,000 Shares of Series B).

If a Shareholder whose Ownership Interest was previously
increased (with a corresponding acquisition of Shares from the other
Shareholder), subsequently has its Ownership Interest decreased, the Shares
to be transferred to the other Shareholder shall be, as necessary: (i) first,
from the same Series of Shares previously acquired from the other
Shareholder, and (ii) only thereafter, from the Series of Shares initially owned
by the Shareholder whose Ownership Interest is being decreased.

Section 4.5 Voluntary Reduction in Ownership. Except with

respect to a Shareholder's obligation to make the contributions required by
Transitory Article 1 of the Bylaws and by Section 10.1 of this Agreement, and
as required by the Initial Program and Budget, as to which no further
election is permitted, a Shareholder may elect, only in accordance with the
procedures specified in Section 9.9 of this Agreement, not to contribute to an
Adopted Program and Budget or to contribute in some lesser amount than its
respective Ownership Interest. If a Shareholder elects to contribute to an
Adopted Program and Budget in some lesser amount than its respective
Ownership Interest, or not at all, and as provided in Section 10.3C with
respect to the Ownership Interest of the Series A Shareholder, the Ownership
Interest of that Shareholder shall be recalculated at the time of election in
accordance with the following formula:

Shareholder's Reduced Ownership Interest = a + b + c
---------
A + B + C

-18-

<PAGE>
where "a" is U.S. $22.5 million which as is specified in Section 10.1 is the
agreed value of the reducing Shareholder's Initial Contribution; "b" is the
total of all of the reducing Shareholder's other contributions to the Company
pursuant to Section 12.2 of this Agreement (including equity and subordinated
debt, but not interest, under DL600) and its proportionate share of any
payments of principal made pursuant to the Project Financing Documents; and
"c" is the amount, if any, the reducing Shareholder elects to contribute to the
Adopted Program and Budget; "A" is U.S. $45 million which, as specified in
Section 10.1, is the agreed value of both Shareholders' Initial Contributions;
"B" is the total of all other contributions by or on behalf of both
Shareholders pursuant to Section 12.2 of this Agreement (including equity and
subordinated debt, but not interest, under DL600) and all payments of
principal made pursuant to the Project Financing Documents; and "C" is the
amount both Shareholders have elected to contribute to the Adopted Program
and Budget. The Ownership Interest of the other Shareholder shall thereupon
become the difference between 100% and the recalculated Ownership Interest of
the reducing Shareholder.

Section 4.6 Elimination of Minority Interest.
--------------------------------

A. Upon the reduction of its Ownership Interest to less than
20%, other than as a result of a Transfer of some but not all of its Shares as
permitted in Article 16, the Shares owned by the reducing Shareholder shall
be automatically converted into Series C Shares, which shall be entitled to
receive only 10% of Net Profits thereafter generated by the Company, as
provided in Exhibit F to this Agreement, upon which conversion the owner of
the Series C Shares shall have no Ownership Interest in, or any rights with
respect to, the Company or the Refugio Project Properties except as provided
in Exhibit F.

B. If a Shareholder has transferred some but not all of its
Shares, the provisions of this Section 4.6 shall be applied to the aggregate
Ownership Interests held by the transferring Shareholder and its transferees,
so that if the aggregate Ownership Interests held by such parties, their
successors and assigns, is reduced to less than 20%, the Shares owned by the
reducing Shareholders shall be automatically converted into Series C Shares,
which shall be entitled to receive only 10% of Net Profits thereafter generated
by the Company, as provided in Exhibit F to this Agreement, upon which
conversion the owners of the Series C Shares shall have no Ownership
Interest in, or any rights with respect to, the Company or the Refugio Project
Properties except as provided in Exhibit F.

C. In no circumstances will the Net Profits payable pursuant to
this Agreement to one or more Series C Shareholders, their successors or
assigns, exceed, in the aggregate, ten percent (10%).

Section 4.7 Transfers of Ownership Interests and Powers of Attorney.
-------------------------------------------------------

A. A Shareholder shall, within three (3) days after the event
or election causing a reduction in its Ownership Interest as provided in
Section 4.5 of this Agreement, transfer to the other Shareholder the number of
Shares necessary to reflect the change in the respective Ownership Interests
of the Shareholders. Such transfer will be effected by a deed or an
instrument of assignment in a form and having such content as is reasonably 
acceptable

-19-
<PAGE>
to the receiving Shareholder and by such other documents and
instruments as reasonably required by the receiving Shareholder.

B. Each Shareholder hereby irrevocably grants to Alberto
Orrego Gamboa, Fernando Hurtado Morales, Sergio Orrego Flory, and Eugenio
Besa Jocelyn-Holt, a power of attorney with full power of substitution to make
all transfers of Shares, to execute all deeds and conveyances, to record the
same by public deed and take all other actions necessary to implement the
provisions of this Section 4.7 and to implement Sections 2.5A(3), 4.5, 4.6, and
10.3B of this Agreement. If a Shareholder whose Ownership Interest is
reduced pursuant to Section 4.5 fails to take all action necessary to effect a
transfer of its Shares as required by this Agreement, Alberto Orrego Gamboa,
Fernando Hurtado Morales, Sergio Orrego Flory, or Eugenio Besa Jocelyn-Holt
shall promptly transfer from the Shareholder whose Ownership Interest is
reduced to the other Shareholder or its designee the requisite number of
Shares so that the Shares of the Company are held by each of the
Shareholders in proportion to its Ownership Interest, and otherwise execute
and record such other documents and instruments as reasonably required to
fully evidence such transfer or conversion, as the case may be. If a
Shareholder whose Ownership Interest is converted to ownership of Series C
Shares pursuant to Sections 2.5A(3), 4.6 or 10.3B fails to take all actions
necessary to effect a conversion of its Ownership Interest, including the
making of all necessary and appropriate changes to the Bylaws, Alberto Orrego
Gamboa, Fernando Hurtado Morales, Sergio Orrego Flory, or Eugenio Besa
Jocelyn-Holt shall promptly take all actions necessary to effect such a
conversion.

C. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the
Shareholders shall take all actions reasonably necessary to implement the
provisions of this Section 4.7, including the execution of a formal power of
attorney in the form of Exhibit J before a Notary Public to authorize the full
implementation of all provisions hereof.

D. The Shareholders acknowledge and agree that the
conversion of Ownership Interest provided for in Sections 4.6 and 10.3B of
this Agreement to ownership of Series C Shares is a reasonable means of
liquidating the damages which will be incurred by the nonconverting
Shareholder if the circumstances giving rise to the conversion occur.

Section 4.8 Limited Continuing Liabilities Upon Adjustment of
-------------------------------------------------
Ownership Interests. The increased Ownership Interest accruing to a
- -------------------
Shareholder as a result of the transfer of the other Shareholder's Ownership
Interest pursuant to Sections 2.5A(3), 4.5, 4.6 or 10.3B shall be free of
royalties, liens, claims or encumbrances, arising by, through, or under such
other Shareholder, other than (i) in the case of both Series of Shares, the Net
Smelter Return royalties payable to CMR pursuant to Clause Fourth of the 1992
Purchase Agreement, (ii) those which the Board has approved and to which
the recipient Shareholder has given its written consent, and (iii) those arising
from Project Financing which the increasing Shareholder has agreed to accept.

Section 4.9 Subordination of Ownership Interests. Each
------------------------------------
Shareholder shall, from time to time, pledge and subordinate its Shares, its
Ownership Interest, any debt owed to it by the Company and any other right
or interest it holds with respect to the Refugio

-20-

<PAGE>
Project Properties or in the Company to any secured borrowings of the Company
approved by the Board, including any Project Financing, and any modifications or
renewals thereof, and shall execute any documents reasonably required by the
lenders in connection with Project Financing.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
------------------

Section 5.1 Organization and Composition. The Company shall be
----------------------------
managed by a board consisting of four directors (the "Board"). Two directors
shall be elected by the Series A Shareholder and two directors shall be
elected by the Series B Shareholder. The Board shall, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, determine overall policies, objectives,
procedures, methods, and actions for the Company. The Series A Shareholder
and the Series B Shareholder may each also elect two or more alternate
directors to the Board to act in the absence of one or more of its elected
regular directors. Any alternate so acting shall be deemed a member of the
Board. The owners each Series of Shares shall give notice to the owners of
the other Series of Shares of the election of its directors and alternates.

Each director and alternate shall serve for a term of 1 year, and
until a successor is elected and shall qualify, or until his or her earlier
death, resignation or removal.

Section 5.2 Votes on Board. The directors in the aggregate shall
--------------
have a total of 100 votes ("Directors' Votes") on all matters to be decided by
the Board, divided between them as herein provided. The directors elected by
the Series A Shareholder shall have in the aggregate the number of Directors'
Votes on the Board equal to its Ownership Interest and the directors elected
by the Series B Shareholder shall have in the aggregate the number of
Directors' Votes on the Board equal to its Ownership Interest; provided,
however, that if a Shareholder owns Shares of both Series A and Series B, the
directors which it elects shall have the aggregate number of Directors' Votes
equal to such Shareholder's total Ownership Interest, and the directors elected
by the other Shareholder shall have the aggregate number of Directors' Votes
equal to the Ownership Interest of the other Shareholder. There shall be
fractional portions of a Directors' Vote, if necessary to correspond to the
Ownership Interests of the Shareholders. If only one of the directors or
alternates elected by the owners of one of the Series of Shares attends a
meeting of the Board, that director or alternate shall be entitled to cast at
that meeting all of the Directors' Votes held by the directors elected by the
owners of the Series of Shares that elected the attending director or
alternate.

Section 5.3 Board and Technical Management Committee Voting Power to 
--------------------------------------------------------
Correspond to Ownership Interests. It is the intent of the Shareholders that if
- ---------------------------------
a Shareholder acquires a majority of the Ownership Interest, such Shareholder
shall have the controlling vote on the Board through the directors it elects,
and Article 10 of the Bylaws and Section 5.2 of this Agreement so provide. The
following example illustrates the manner in which the provisions of Article 10
of the Bylaws and Section 5.2 of this Agreement will operate:

-21-
<PAGE>
If a Shareholder acquires a majority of the Ownership Interest
(becomes a "Majority Owner"), the directors elected by the Majority Owner
(regardless of the Series of Shares initially owned by that Shareholder) will
be entitled to cast a majority of the Directors' Votes on the Board. For
example, if the Majority Owner holds an Ownership Interest of 51.03%, the
directors it elects would be entitled to cast 51.03 Directors' Votes on all
matters that come before the Board and the directors elected by the other
Shareholder would be entitled to cast 48.97 Directors' Votes on all such
matters. In this example, the directors elected by the Majority Owner would
be able to decide all matters that come before the Board, except those matters
which, as provided in Section 6.5 of this Agreement, require the unanimous
approval of the Board.

The number of votes each member of the Technical Management
Committee shall be entitled to cast shall be determined in the same manner, as
is provided in Section 7.2 of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 6

APPROVAL BY BOARD
-----------------

Section 6.1 Vote Necessary For Approval. A majority of the Directors'
---------------------------
Votes shall be required to constitute the action of the Board at any meeting at
which a quorum is present, provided, however, that if the Board is deadlocked by
an inability to obtain a majority of the Directors' Votes with respect to any
matter within the scope of its authority, except those matters specifically
identified in Sections 6.3 and 6.5 of this Agreement, the Chairman of the Board,
or in his absence, his alternate, is hereby authorized and empowered to cast the
deciding vote with respect to such matter, and thereby to determine the action
of the Board with respect thereto. The directors shall take all actions
necessary, including without limitation the signing of minutes of Board action,
to give effect to any decision of the Board made as a result of the casting of
the deciding vote by the Chairman of the Board or his alternate as provided in
this Section 6.1.

Section 6.2 Appointment of Chairman of the Board. So long as
------------------------------------
AGRI and/or its Affiliates are the owners of all the Series B Shares, a director
elected by the Series B Shareholder shall serve as Chairman of the Board. If
AGRI and/or its Affiliates do not own all of the Series B Shares, a director
chosen by a majority vote of the directors shall act as Chairman of the Board.
The Chairman of the Board, or in his absence, his alternate, shall conduct all
Board meetings. The procedures for Board meetings shall be as determined by
the Board.

Section 6.3 Actions Requiring Affirmative Majority Approval of the
------------------------------------------------------
Board. The following actions shall require an Affirmative Majority Approval
- -----
of the Board and shall not be subject to the authority provided to the
Chairman in Section 6.1 of this Agreement to break deadlocks:

or other disposition of any mining claims, surface rights or water rights
having a value of less than U.S. $2 million;

Approval or the unanimous approval of the Board or of the Shareholders
where so required by this Agreement, or

(2) was previously settled by arbitration pursuant to Article
17 of this Agreement or Article 35 of the Bylaws,

but nothing in this Section 6.3M shall prevent the Chairman of the Technical
Management Committee from proposing an amendment to an Adopted Program
and Budget as provided in Section 9.12 of this Agreement.

Section 6.4 Material Change to the Preliminary Construction
-----------------------------------------------
Budget. As used in this Agreement, "Material Change to the Preliminary
- ------
Construction Budget" means any of the following changes made as a result of
Detailed Engineering which are to be implemented prior to the Completion of
Construction:

A. changes in the design or type of equipment or facilities
incorporated in the Construction Budget, which changes, as compared to the
Preliminary Construction Budget, would cause a net increase or decrease
greater than 5% in the total estimated costs for Project Construction;

B. changes in the mine plan incorporated in the Construction
Budget, which changes, as compared to the mine plan on which the Preliminary
Construction Budget was based, would cause a net increase or decrease in
estimated production greater than 15,000 ounces of gold bullion in any of the
first five years after the Completion of Construction; or

C. changes in the methods used to process ores contemplated
by the Construction Budget, which changes, as compared to the projections on
which the Preliminary Construction Budget was based, would cause a net 
life-of-mine increase or decrease in estimated total gold production greater 
than 3%.

Section 6.5 Matters Requiring Unanimous Approval of the Board.
-------------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of the Bylaws, so
long as AGRI (or an Affiliate of AGRI) and Bema Bermuda (or an Affiliate of
Bema Bermuda) each have an Ownership Interest, the following matters shall
require unanimous approval of the Board, even though one such Shareholder
owns a majority of the Ownership Interest:

A. A decision to suspend (after Completion of Construction)
Mining of the Verde deposit (as identified in the Project Feasibility Study) for
a period of six months or longer, not caused by governmental action or
inaction, inability to obtain equipment or

-24-

supplies in the ordinary course, strikes or labor difficulties, or any other
force majeure; but provided that neither this restriction nor any other
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to require that Mining be conducted
at an operating loss after Completion of Construction;

B. The abandonment, sale or disposition of all or substantially
all of the Assets, except that such restriction shall not apply to sales or
dispositions of Products, surplus or obsolete plant or equipment or other
materials in the ordinary course of business; or

C. A capital outlay for an expansion of facilities subsequent to
Completion of Construction greater than U.S. $8 million in any one year.

Section 6.6 Failure to Obtain Unanimous Consent or Affirmative
--------------------------------------------------
Majority Approval. If a matter requiring the unanimous approval of the Board
- -----------------
pursuant to Sections 3.4, 6.5, 8.3 or 9.3 of this Agreement or Affirmative
Majority Approval of the Board pursuant to Sections 6.3, 7.7, 9.1, 9.2, 9.4,
9.5, 9.7, 9.10, 11.2, or 11.4 of this Agreement does not receive such unanimous
or majority approval, as the case may be, either Shareholder may submit the
matter to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of this
Agreement. If the matter submitted to arbitration involves a proposal by the
Series B Shareholder to make Material Change to the Construction Phase Program
and Budget (as defined in Section 7.7), the Series B Shareholder shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to cause the Technical Management Committee to
proceed with the proposed change prior to the arbitrator's ruling, subject to
the provisions of Section 17.5M of this Agreement. If neither Shareholder
submits to arbitration a matter which requires Affirmative Majority Approval
pursuant to Sections 7.7, 9.4, 9.5 and 9.10 but which failed to receive such
approval within 30 days after the Board meeting at which the matter was
considered, the matter shall be deemed decided in accordance with the vote of
the Chairman of the Board.

TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
------------------------------

Section 7.1 Appointment of Committee and Chairman. The Board
-------------------------------------
shall appoint from its members a Technical Management Committee, which shall
have overall responsibility for implementing Operations. The Technical
Management Committee shall consist of one regular and one or more alternate
members appointed by the owners of the Series A Shares and one regular
member and one or more alternate members appointed by the owners of the
Series B Shares. The Technical Management Committee shall be administered
by one member acting as Chairman. So long as the Ownership Interests of the
Shareholders remain equal and AGRI and/or an Affiliate of AGRI continues to
own the Series B Shares, the Chairman of the Technical Management Committee
shall be the member appointed by the Series B Shareholder. Notwithstanding
the preceding provisions of this Section 7.1, if the Ownership Interests of the
Shareholders become unequal, the party owning a majority of the Ownership
Interest shall be entitled to appoint the Chairman of the Technical Management
Committee, until such time, if ever, as the Ownership Interests of the

-25-

Shareholders again become equal, at which time the Chairman of the Technical
Management Committee would again be a director elected by the Series B
Shareholder.

-------------------
Management Committee collectively shall have a total of 100 votes, divided
between them as herein provided. The member of the Technical Management

Series A Shareholder and the member of the Technical Management Committee
appointed by the Series B Shareholder shall have a number of votes on the
Technical Management Committee equal to the Ownership Interest of the Series
B Shareholder; provided, however, that if a Shareholder owns Shares of both
Series A and Series B, the member of the Technical Management Committee
which it appoints shall have the aggregate number of votes equal to such
Shareholder's total Ownership Interest, and the member of the Technical
Management Committee appointed by the other Shareholder shall have the
aggregate number of votes equal to the Ownership Interest of the other
Shareholder. There shall be fractional portions of a vote, if necessary to
correspond to the Ownership Interests of the Shareholders.

A majority of the votes of the Technical Management Committee
shall be required to constitute action of the Technical Management Committee.
If the Technical Management Committee is deadlocked by an inability to obtain
a majority of votes with respect to any matter within the scope of its
authority, the Chairman of the Technical Management Committee or his
alternate is hereby authorized and empowered to cast the deciding vote with
respect to such matter and thereby to determine the action of the Committee.

Section 7.3 Meetings of Technical Management Committee. As soon
------------------------------------------
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Technical Management
Committee shall meet for the purposes of organization and the transaction of
other business. Regular meetings of the Technical Management Committee shall

Section 7.6 Submission of Additional Information to Chairman.
------------------------------------------------
Section 7.2 of this Agreement provides that the Chairman of the Technical
Management Committee is authorized to cast the deciding vote in the event of
a deadlock. Each Shareholder shall have had the opportunity, during the
seven day period following the meeting at which a deadlock of the Technical
Management Committee occurred, to make a further submission to the Chairman
on the matter in question. As soon as the deadlock occurs, each Shareholder
shall advise the Chairman whether it wishes to make such a submission. If
neither Shareholder so advises the Chairman, the Technical Management
Committee may then act with respect to the matter in accordance with the
Chairman's vote. If either or both Shareholders make a submission, the
Chairman shall in good faith consider the submission or submissions and the
Technical Management Committee shall take no action on the matter for a
period of seven days after the meeting at which the deadlock occurred, unless
urgent operational considerations require that the matter be acted on in a
shorter period, in which case the Chairman shall so notify the Shareholders
and any additional submission shall be made within such shortened period. If
after reviewing the additional submissions, the Chairman decides to change his
or her vote on the matter, the Chairman shall notify the other member of the
Technical Management Committee, and shall promptly convene a meeting of the
Technical Management Committee to reconsider the matter. If after reviewing
the additional submissions, the Chairman does not wish to change his or her
vote, the matter will be deemed finally decided in accordance with the
Chairman's vote.

Section 7.7 Approval of Construction Change Orders.
--------------------------------------

A. The Chairman of the Technical Management Committee or his
designee shall have authority to approve all changes and modifications to the
Construction Phase Program and Budget and all contracts awarded for Project
Construction that are in his or her judgment reasonable and prudent to
achieve the Completion of Construction; provided, however, that Affirmative
Majority Approval shall be required for any change or modification which
Constitutes a Material Change to the Construction Phase Program and Budget.
Before authorizing a change or modification to the Construction Program and

-27-
<PAGE>

Budget which involves a net increase or decrease of more than U.S. $500,000
to a line item of the Construction Budget the matter shall be considered at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting of the Technical Management Committee.
The notice of any such meeting shall be accompanied by an agenda identifying
the proposed change or modification. The Chairman of the Technical
Management Committee shall promptly inform the Technical Management
Committee of each such change or modification he or she has made or
approved which does not require Affirmative Majority Approval or prior review
with the Technical Management Committee.

B. As used in this Agreement, "Material Change to the
Construction Phase Program and Budget" means any of the following, if
implemented prior to the Completion of Construction:

(1) changes in the design or type of equipment or
facilities, which changes, as compared to the Construction Budget, would cause
a net increase or decrease greater than 5% in the total estimated costs for
Project Construction;

(2) changes in the mine plan, which changes, as compared
to the Construction Phase Program and Budget mine plan, would cause a net
increase or decrease in estimated production greater than 15,000 ounces of
gold bullion in any of the first five years after the Completion of
Construction; or

(3) changes in the methods used to process ores, which
changes, as compared to the Construction Phase Program and Budget
projections, would cause a net life-of-mine increase or decrease in estimated
total gold extraction greater than 3%.

C. Any overrun of the Construction Budget which does not
result directly from one of the circumstances specified in Section 7.7B shall
not be considered a Material Change to the Construction Phase Program and
Budget and shall not require Affirmative Majority Approval. Subject only to
the requirements of Section 7.7A, the Chairman of the Technical Management
Committee, after consultation with the Technical Management Committee, is
authorized to overrun the Construction Budget without limitation.

approves the Revised Feasibility Study or such study as modified, the study thus
approved shall be deemed the Project Feasibility Study. If at such meeting the
Board fails to unanimously approve a feasibility study, the August 1992
Feasibility Study shall be deemed the Project Feasibility Study. The Project
Feasibility Study will include a preliminary budget for Project Construction
(the "Preliminary Construction Budget").

Section 9.4 Engineering Phase Program and Budget.
------------------------------------

A. Either Shareholder may propose, at any time, that the
Engineering Phase Program be commenced. However, unless the Board
otherwise determines by Affirmative Majority Approval (subject to the
provisions of Section 17.2F), the Engineering Phase Program and Budget shall
not commence until after (i) both Shareholders have approved Project
Financing and are able to fund the Equity/Junior Subordinated Debt
component of the Financing Plan in accordance with Section 2.4 of this
Agreement or, in the absence of such conditions, (ii) one Shareholder has
elected to proceed in accordance with Section 2.5 of this Agreement. Promptly
upon the occurrence of either the circumstances of Section 9.4A(i) or 9.4A(ii),
the Chairman of the Technical Management Committee after consulting with the
committee will prepare and submit to the Board an Engineering Phase Program
and Budget.

B. Within 20 days after the submission of a proposed
Engineering Phase Program and Budget, the Board shall hold a meeting at
which the directors shall:

(1) Approve the proposed Engineering Phase Program and
Budget; or

(2) Propose modifications to the proposed Engineering
Phase Program and Budget; or

(3) Reject the proposed Engineering Phase Program and
Budget.

If at such meeting the directors by an Affirmative Majority Approval adopt the
proposed Engineering Phase Program and Budget or some modification thereof,
the Program and Budget thus adopted shall be the Engineering Phase Program
and Budget. If at such meeting the directors fail to adopt an Engineering
Phase Program and Budget, the directors elected by either Series of Shares
shall be authorized to refer the matter to arbitration pursuant to Article 17 of
this Agreement. The Engineering Phase Program and Budget determined by
such arbitration shall be deemed to have been adopted by the Board on the
date of the arbitration award.

C. The Engineering Phase Program shall be devoted principally
to Detailed Engineering of the Project Feasibility Study. In conjunction with
Detailed Engineering, the Preliminary Construction Budget shall be reviewed
and a revised budget for Project Construction (the "Revised Construction
Budget") shall be prepared.

Section 9.5 Construction Phase Program and Budget.
-------------------------------------

A. If the Revised Construction Budget does not include a
Material Change to the Preliminary Construction Budget (as defined in Section
6.4 of this Agreement), the Revised Construction Budget shall be deemed
adopted by the Board and shall automatically become the Construction Budget.
If the Revised Construction Budget does include a Material Change to the
Preliminary Construction Budget, the Board shall, within 30 days after receipt
thereof, meet to consider the Revised Construction Budget. If at such meeting
the Board by Affirmative Majority Approval adopts the Revised Construction
Budget or another budget, such budget shall be the Construction Budget. If
at such meeting the Board fails by Affirmative Majority Approval to adopt the
Revised Construction Budget or by Affirmative Majority Approval to adopt
another budget as the Construction Budget, the directors elected by either
Series of Shares shall be authorized to refer the matter to arbitration as
provided in Article 17 of this Agreement. The budget determined by such
arbitration shall be the Construction Budget and shall be deemed to have been
adopted by the Board on the date of the arbitration award. The Construction
Budget, however adopted or determined, shall include appropriate escalations
and contingencies.

B. Upon adoption by the Board or determination by arbitration,
as provided in this Section 9.5, the Construction Budget, and the Program
necessary to achieve Project Construction in accordance therewith, shall be
deemed the Construction Phase Program and Budget. The Construction Phase
Program and Budget will cover the period from its effective date until the
start of the first Budget Period occurring after the Completion of
Construction, unless the duration of the Construction Phase Program and
Budget is modified by the Board.

Section 9.6 Preparation of Programs and Budgets After Completion of 
-------------------------------------------------------
Construction.
- ------------

A. On or before May 1 and November 1 each year, starting on the
first such date after the Completion of Construction, the Technical Management
Committee shall prepare and submit to the Board a proposed Program and
Budget for the ensuing Budget Period. Each such proposed Program and
Budget shall be in a form and degree of detail approved by the Board, which
once established shall thereafter be utilized, unless the Board otherwise
determines.

B. In preparing each proposed Program and Budget for a
Budget Period after the Completion of Construction, the Chairman of the
Technical Management Committee shall determine the extent to which and the
sources from which funds will be required to implement the proposed Program
and Budget. In making such determinations, the Chairman of the Technical
Management Committee shall as a first priority look to the Company's available
cash flow.

Section 9.7 Adoption of Programs and Budgets After Completion
-------------------------------------------------
of Construction.
- ---------------

A. Within 20 days after submission of any proposed Program and
Budget, (other than the Initial Program and Budget, which the Shareholders
have approved, the Engineering Phase Program and Budget, which shall be
adopted or determined as provided in Section 9.4 of this Agreement, and the
Construction Phase Program and Budget, which shall be adopted or determined
as provided in Section 9.5 of this Agreement) the Board shall hold a meeting
at which the directors shall:

(1) Approve the proposed Program and Budget; or

(2) Propose modifications to the proposed Program and Budget; or

(3) Reject the proposed Program and Budget.

If at such meeting the directors by an Affirmative Majority Approval adopt the
proposed Program and Budget or some modification thereof, the Program and
Budget thus adopted shall be the Program and Budget for the ensuing Budget
Period. If at such meeting the directors fail to adopt a Program and Budget,
the Board, subject to the provisions of Section 9.8 of this Agreement shall
immediately endeavor in good faith to develop a Program and Budget for the
ensuing Budget Period which may be adopted by Affirmative Majority Approval
of the Board.

Section 9.8 Failure of Board to Adopt Programs and Budgets
----------------------------------------------
after Completion of Construction. After the Completion of Construction, if the
- --------------------------------
Board fails, for any reason, to approve a Program and Budget by June 15 or
December 15, as the case may be, the directors elected by either Series of
Shares shall be authorized to refer the matter to arbitration pursuant to
Article 17 of this Agreement. If the Board fails to adopt a Program and
Budget for any such Budget Period, the Technical Management Committee shall
be authorized to continue Operations at levels of production and expenditure
comparable with the last Adopted Program and Budget, unless the Board
otherwise directs by Affirmative Majority Approval, and the last Adopted
Program and Budget shall be deemed extended at such levels.

For purposes of this Section 9.8, Operations shall be considered to
at "levels of production and expenditure comparable with the last Adopted
Program and Budget" if both the costs of, and the quantity of gold bullion
produced by, such Operations are not more than 10% larger or smaller than,
respectively, the inflation-adjusted costs and gold bullion production in the
last Adopted Program and Budget. For purposes of this Section 9.8,
"inflation-adjusted costs" shall be determined by multiplying the budgeted
costs by one plus the rate of increase or one minus the rate of decrease in
the Unidad de Fomentos since the start of the Budget Period covered by the
last Adopted Program and Budget.

Section 9.9 Election to Participate in Programs and Budgets. By
-----------------------------------------------
notice to the Board within twenty (20) days after the adoption or
determination by arbitration of an

-32-
<PAGE>
Adopted Program and Budget, (including the Engineering Phase Program and Budget
and the Construction Phase Program and Budget; but excluding the Initial Program
and Budget) a Shareholder may elect to contribute to such Adopted Program and
Budget in some lesser amount than its respective Ownership Interest, or not at
all, in which cases its Ownership Interest shall be recalculated as provided in
Section 4.5 of this Agreement. If a Shareholder fails to so notify the Board of
its election with respect to such an Adopted Program and Budget within such 20
day period, the Shareholder shall be deemed to have elected to contribute to
such Adopted Program and Budget in proportion to its respective Ownership
Interest as of the beginning of the period covered by the Adopted Program and
Budget.

Section 9.10 Budget Overruns and Program Changes. The
-----------------------------------
Chairman of the Technical Management Committee shall promptly notify the
Board of any actual or anticipated material departure from an Adopted
Program and Budget. The Technical Management Committee shall not exceed an
adopted Budget (other than the Construction Budget, for which overruns not
resulting directly from a Material Change to the Construction Phase Program
and Budget, shall not be limited except as expressly provided in Section 7.7)
by more than 10% unless expressly authorized by the Affirmative Majority
Approval of the Board. The Chairman of the Technical Management Committee
shall have the authority to overrun the Construction Budget, subject only to
those matters specified in Section 7.7 of this Agreement. Budget overruns
shall be borne by the Shareholders in proportion to their respective
Ownership Interests as of the time the overrun occurs, subject to the
provisions of Section 11.2 of this Agreement.

Section 9.11 Emergency and Unexpected Expenditures.
-------------------------------------
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of the Bylaws, in
case of emergency, the Technical Management Committee may take any
reasonable action it deems necessary to protect life or property, to protect
the Assets or to comply with law or government regulation. The Chairman of
the Technical Management Committee shall promptly notify the Board of any
emergency expenditure. The costs of actions resulting from emergencies shall
be borne by the Shareholders in portion to their respective Ownership
Interests as of the time the emergency occurs.

Section 9.12 Amendment of Programs and Budgets. At any time,
---------------------------------
the Chairman of the Technical Management Committee, after consultation with
the Technical Management Committee, may propose the amendment of an
Adopted Program and Budget, in which event the procedures of Sections 9.4B,
9.5 or 9.7 as the case may be shall apply. If as a result of such proposed
amendment, the Adopted Program and Budget is revised, each Shareholder
shall make one of the elections specified in Section 9.9 with respect to such
revised Adopted Program and Budget, within the time therein specified.

Section 10.2 Use of Initial Contributions. The contributions to the
----------------------------

Agreement, shall be used as follows:

A. The contributions made by the Series B Shareholder shall be
used to pay the Fixed Portion (as therein defined) of the purchase price
pursuant to Clause Fourth of the 1992 Purchase Agreement, but not the
Variable Portion (as therein defined); and

B. The contributions made by the Series A Shareholder shall be
used to make payments due pursuant to the Data License and to the Promise

Section 10.3 Default in Making Contributions. Subject to the
-------------------------------
provisions of Section 10.4, the Shareholders acknowledge that if a Shareholder
defaults in making a contribution to an Adopted Program and Budget in which,
pursuant to Section 9.9 of this Agreement, it has elected to participate or is
deemed to have elected to participate, it will be difficult to measure the
damages resulting therefrom. The non-defaulting Shareholder may,

-35-
<PAGE>
with respect to any such default not cured within 10 days after delivery of
notice of such default to the defaulting Shareholder, elect one of the following
remedies by giving notice to the defaulting Shareholder:

A. The non-defaulting Shareholder shall have the right but not
the obligation to advance or cause to be advanced to the Company, as
subordinated debt under DL600 or otherwise, the defaulted contribution on
behalf of the defaulting Shareholder and treat the same, together with any
accrued interest, as a demand loan to the defaulting Shareholder (a "Default
Loan") bearing interest from the date of the advance until paid at the
Effective Interest Rate plus an additional two percent, but in no event at a
rate higher than the maximum rate permitted by law. A Default Loan and any
security interest relating thereto shall be subordinate to the Project Financing
or any other secured debt, unless otherwise agreed by the creditor of any
such Project Financing or other secured debt. The non-defaulting
Shareholder agrees to evidence such subordination by such instruments as
such creditor may reasonably request. The failure to repay a Default Loan
upon demand shall be a default, with respect to which the non-defaulting
Shareholder shall have the right but not the obligation to make a Default
Loan. Failure timely to repay any Default Loan shall entitle to other
Shareholder to enforce the security for the loan and to exercise the rights
provided in Section 10.3B.

Each Shareholder hereby grants to the other a lien upon its
interest in the Shares, the Assets and a pledge of and security interest in its
Shares and in its Ownership Interest, including its interest in Products and
the proceeds therefrom, to secure any Default Loan made hereunder, including
interest thereon, reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in recovering the loan with interest and in enforcing such
lien, pledge, or security interest, or both, but in all cases subordinated to
any Project Financing or other secured debt now or hereafter incurred by the
Company, as provided above.

B. The non-defaulting Shareholder may elect, by notice to the
defaulting Shareholder at any time within fifteen (15) days after expiration of
the cure period provided in this Section 10.3, or on failure to repay a Default
Loan on demand to have all of the Shares owned by the defaulting
Shareholder converted into Series C Shares, which shall be entitled to receive
only 10% of Net Profits thereafter generated by the Company, determined as
provided in Exhibit F to this Agreement, upon which conversion the defaulting
Shareholder shall have no Ownership Interest in, or any rights with respect
to, the Company or the Refugio Project Properties except as provided in
Exhibit F.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
Series A Shareholder (1) defaults with respect to the repayment of principal
or interest on any Initial Program Loan, or (2) fails to make timely any
contribution for the Initial Program and Budget which it is required to make
prior to the earlier of December 31, 1993 or the acceptance by the Series A
Shareholder of a written commitment for Project Financing, the Ownership
Interest of the Series A Shareholder shall be reduced and the Ownership
Interest of the Series B Shareholder shall be increased in accordance with the
formula set forth in Section 4.5 of this Agreement, using the amount of such
defaulted loan payment or the

-36-
<PAGE>
amount not contributed to the Initial Program and Budget, as the case may be, as
the basis for such adjustment of Ownership Interests.

Section 10.4 Default in Contribution to Construction Phase
---------------------------------------------
Program and Budget. The provisions of Section 10.3 shall apply during the
- ------------------
Construction Phase Program, unless the default of a Shareholder in timely
contributing additional equity required by the Construction Phase Budget is
the direct result of the failure or refusal by the lender providing Project
Financing to provide funds it has committed to provide, other than such a
failure or refusal resulting from an act or omission of the defaulting
Shareholder.

Section 10.5 Reimbursement of IVA Distribution. If the Company
---------------------------------
receives reimbursement of, and distributes to the Series A Shareholder, any
IVA paid in connection with the purchase of the Existing Exploration and
Evaluation Data, as provided in Section 10.1C, which must thereafter be
reimbursed by the Company to the government, Bema Bermuda shall bear all
costs making all such payments of such IVA. Bema Bermuda shall indemnify
and hold AGRI and its Affiliates harmless from and against all costs of
repayment of such IVA and all costs relating thereto. If such IVA and all
costs relating thereto are not paid to the Company by Bema Bermuda no fewer
than thirty days prior to the date on which such IVA must be paid to the
government, such failure shall be deemed to constitute a default in making
contributions to an Adopted Program and Budget under Section 10.3 hereof,
provided that the cure period with respect to such default shall be reduced
to five days after notice of default.

Section 10.6 Remedies Cumulative. A non-defaulting Shareholder
-------------------
may elect one or more of the remedies available to it under this Agreement,
or, to the extent a Shareholder has a cause of action for damages, or a lien,
pledge or security interest under applicable law, it shall be entitled to its
rights and remedies at law and in equity, subject to the conditions and
limitations of Article 17 of this Agreement. All such remedies shall be
cumulative. The election of one or more remedies shall not waive the election
of any other remedies.

LOANS
-----

Section 11.1 Initial Program Loan. If the Series A Shareholder so
--------------------
requests, at least five days in advance of the date on which such contributions
are due, the Series B Shareholder shall fund any contributions which the Series
A Shareholder is required to make prior to April 1, 1993 pursuant to the Initial
Program and Budget, up to an aggregate total of U.S. $600,000. All funds
advanced by or on behalf of the Series B Shareholder to the Company for the
benefit of the Series A Shareholder pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall be
treated as a loan from the Series B Shareholder to the Series A Shareholder (an
"Initial Program Loan"). An Initial Program Loan shall be evidenced by a note
substantially in the form of Exhibit M to this Agreement, and shall be subject
to Section 11.5 of this Agreement. Any default by the Series A Shareholder in
the payment of principal or interest due with respect to an Initial Program Loan
shall, result in a reduction of the Ownership Interest of the Series A
Shareholder and a corresponding increase in the Ownership Interest of the Series
B Shareholder, as provided in Section 10.3C of this Agreement. The Series A
Shareholder shall execute any and all documents, promissory notes and other
instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Series B Shareholder to
evidence the obligations of the Series A Shareholder pursuant to all Initial
Program Loans.

Section 11.2 Construction Credit Facility Loan. Upon approval by
---------------------------------
the Board of the Construction Phase Program and Budget, unless the Series B
Shareholder has elected to proceed pursuant to Section 2.5, the Series A
Shareholder may request from the Series B Shareholder a credit facility, not
to exceed U.S. $10 million, to be used exclusively for purposes of funding the
contribution obligations of the Series A Shareholder for the costs of Project
Construction under the Construction Phase Program and Budget, as such

-37-
<PAGE>
contributions become due. The Series B Shareholder shall have the right to
determine in its sole and absolute discretion whether to extend the requested
credit facility, and shall respond to a request for a credit facility within 10
days after its receipt. Each advance made under this credit facility (a
"Construction Credit Facility Loan") shall be evidenced by a note substantially
in the form of Exhibit O to this Agreement and shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 11.5 this Agreement.

A. If the Series B Shareholder extends a credit facility
pursuant to this Section 11.1, the credit facility shall be deemed accepted by
the Series A Shareholder and the proceeds of all Construction Credit Facility
Loans shall be paid by or on behalf of the Series B Shareholder to the
Company on behalf of the Series A Shareholder and used solely to fund, (only
to the extent of such Construction Credit Facility Loan) the contribution
obligations of the Series A Shareholder for the costs of Project Construction
under the Construction Phase Program and Budget, as such contributions
become due. The Series A Shareholder shall execute any and all documents,
promissory notes and other instruments as may be reasonably requested by
the Series B Shareholder to evidence the obligations of the Series A
Shareholder pursuant to the credit facility and Construction Credit Facility
Loan.

B. If the Series B Shareholder determines not to extend the
credit facility, Project Construction shall not be commenced and in lieu of the
Construction Phase Program and Budget, the Technical Management Committee
shall undertake only those activities necessary to maintain title to the Refugio
Project Properties and for the maintenance of the Assets ("Asset Maintenance
Costs"), unless and until the Board determines otherwise by Affirmative
Majority Approval; provided, however, that in such event either Shareholder
may proceed under Section 2.5 of this Agreement. Each Shareholder hereby
commits to contribute timely its proportionate share of all Asset Maintenance
Costs in accordance with its Ownership Interest, and agrees that the failure to
do so will constitute a default in making a required contribution to an
Adopted Program and Budget. If a Shareholder defaults in making a
contribution required by this Section 11.2 for Asset Maintenance Costs, the
nondefaulting Shareholder shall have all the rights and remedies specified in
Section 10.3 with respect to any such default.

Section 11.3 Construction Overrun Loan. If both the Series A
-------------------------
Shareholder and the Series B Shareholder have elected pursuant to Section 9.9
to participate in the Construction Phase Program and Budget, or if the Series
A Shareholder pursuant to Sections 2.5A(1) or 2.5A(2) has elected to
participate in a project proposed by the Series B Shareholder (provided that
if the election was pursuant to Section 2.5A(2) the Series B Shareholder has
elected to extend a credit facility as provided in Section 11.4), then upon the
request of the Series A Shareholder, the Series B Shareholder shall fund any
contributions needed for Project Construction (but only for Project
Construction) required from the Series A Shareholder in excess of its
proportionate share of the Construction Budget, including any additional
contributions required to fund Change Orders. All funds advanced by or on
behalf or the Series B Shareholder pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall be paid
to the Company on behalf of the Series A Shareholder and shall be treated as
a loan from the Series B Shareholder to the Series A Shareholder (a
"Construction Overrun Loan"). A Construction

as provided in Section 11.4), then upon the request of the Series A Shareholder,
the Series B Shareholder shall fund any contributions needed for Project
Construction (but only for Project Construction) required from the Series A
Shareholder in excess of its proportionate share of the Construction Budget,

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of
the Series B Shareholder under this Section 11.3 shall remain in force and
effect only so long as (i) Bema Bermuda or an Affiliate of Bema Bermuda owns all
of the Series A Shares (other than any such Shares held by AGRI or its
Affiliates), and (ii) there is no change in control of Bema Bermuda. As used in
this Section 11.3, "control" means possession, directly or indirectly, of the
power to direct or cause direction of management and policies through ownership
of voting securities, contract, voting trust or otherwise.

Section 11.4 Project Construction Loan. Pursuant to Section 2.5A (2) the
-------------------------
Notified Shareholder may request from the Notifying Shareholder a credit
facility, to be used exclusively for purposes of funding the contribution
obligations of the Notified Shareholder for the costs of Project Construction of
the proposed project, as such contributions become due. The Notifying
Shareholder shall have the right to determine in its sole and absolute
discretion whether to extend the requested credit facility, and shall respond to
a request for a credit facility within 10 days after its receipt. Each advance
made under this credit facility (a "Project Construction Loan") shall evidenced
by a note substantially in the form of Exhibit N to this Agreement and subject
to the provisions of Section 11.5 this Agreement.

A. If the Notifying Shareholder extends a credit facility

determines otherwise by Affirmative Majority Approval; provided, however, that
in such event either Shareholder may proceed under Section 2.5 of this
Agreement. Each Shareholder hereby commits to contribute timely its
proportionate share of all Asset Maintenance Costs in accordance with its
Ownership Interest, and agrees that the failure to do so will constitute a
default in making a required contribution to an Adopted Program and Budget. If a
Shareholder defaults in making a contribution required by this Section 11.4 for
Asset Maintenance Costs, the nondefaulting Shareholder shall have all the rights
and remedies specified in Section 10.3 with respect to any such default.

Section 11.5 Terms of Loans. If the Series B Shareholder or an
--------------
Affiliate of the Series A Shareholder makes an Initial Program Loan, a
Construction Credit Facility Loan and/or a Construction Overrun Loan on

for an Initial Program Loan shall be LIBOR plus two percent, and in each case,
net of any withholding taxes, reserve requirements, and other costs and
expenses of making or holding such loans, all of which shall be the
responsibility of the Shareholder on whose behalf the loan was made, it being
the intent of the Shareholders that the interest rate payable to the
Shareholder extending such a loan shall be a net rate;

C. Repaid firstly, to the Shareholder entitled to repayment or
its order, outside Chile and net of any Chilean taxes, as to interest which has

----------------------------------------
Technical Management Committee shall submit to each Shareholder prior to the
last day of each month, a request for the contribution of additional equity to
the Company in an amount corresponding to the estimated cash requirements

Project Construction Loan, Construction Credit Facility Loan, Construction
Overrun Loan, Default Loan or demand loan, the Technical Management
Committee shall apply as a credit against the contribution request any funds
held by the Company for the benefit of the Shareholder to which the
contribution request is directed. Within 10 days after receipt of a
contribution request, each Shareholder shall pay to the Company its
proportionate share of the amount by which its requested contribution exceeds
its available share of such credits. Time is of the essence with respect to
such payments. The Technical Management Committee shall at all times
maintain a cash balance approximately equal to the rate of disbursement for
up to 90 days. All funds in excess of immediate cash requirements shall be
invested for the benefit of the Company in interest-bearing accounts in such
bank or banks as is determined by the Technical Management Committee or the

Contributions by Shareholders shall be made in cash by means of
capital contributions or loans evidenced by junior subordinated debt
obligations of the Company to such Shareholder or its designee, evidenced by
a promissory note in the form of Exhibit L to this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by the Project Financing Documents. For purposes of determining
the amount of contributions made by the Shareholders under Section 4.5 of
this Agreement, the amount of principal outstanding that has been contributed
in the form of loans evidenced by junior subordinated debt obligations and
accrued by unpaid interest thereon, shall be treated as a contribution to the
Company. It is agreed that amounts contributed in the form of junior
subordinated debt obligations shall be at a variable interest rates not to
exceed the then current LIBOR, plus three percent, and that no interest,
principal or other payments shall be made with respect to such debt
obligations except to the extent that the Board declares there is Cash
Available for Distribution. Interest shall accrue until the same is paid. The
Shareholder for whose benefit the loan was extended shall pay all stamp tax
and Chilean withholding tax, and shall be responsible for all costs of the
reserve requirements of the Banco Central de Chile.

Shareholder that fails to contribute additional equity in the amount and at the
times specified in Section 12.2 shall be in default, and the amounts of the
defaulted contribution request shall bear interest from the date due at the
Effective Interest Rate, plus an additional two percent, but in no event, shall
the rate of interest exceed the maximum permitted by law. The non-defaulting
Shareholder shall have those rights, remedies and elections specified in
Section 10.3 of this Agreement.

Section 12.4 Cash Available for Distributions. "Cash Available for

term debt and debt required for working capital purposes contemplated by
Section 6.3H,

(2) Debt service requirements for all third party Company
debt due within three months; and

reclamation and other governmental obligations.

Cash Available for Distribution shall exclude the effects of any
monetary revaluations required by Chilean law for tax or other purposes but

converting between United States dollars and Chilean pesos.

If the sum of 12.4B(1), (2) and (3) exceeds U.S. $10,000,000, the
Board may consider the distribution of a portion of such excess amount, if in
its judgment the excess can be distributed without adversely impacting the
Company's financial position.

Section 12.5 Payments and Distributions.

A. The Cash Available for Distributions, whether as payment for
principal or interest on any subordinated debt to the Shareholders or their

Shareholder; and (ii) shall be increased by an amount equal to the benefit of
any first category tax deduction obtained by CMM due to such payments to
CMR;

(b) Cash Available for Distribution attributable to the
Series A Shareholder shall be increased by an amount equal to (i) the benefit
of any first category tax deduction that has been obtained by CMM from data,
services invoiced and other purchases or acquisitions made by CMM with the

amount of interest paid by Banco de Chile for time deposits in dollars,
from the time such deduction is taken by the Company until the time it is

(a) Cash Available for Distribution attributed to the Series
B Shareholder shall be (i) reduced by all royalties and payments made by CMM
to CMR under Article Fourth Sections 2)B) and 2)C), of the 1992 Purchase
Agreement, the burden of which payments shall be borne exclusively by the
Series B Shareholder; and (ii) increased by an amount equal to the benefit of
any first category tax deduction obtained by CMM due to such payments to
CMR;

(b) Cash Available for Distribution to the Series B
Shareholder shall be increased by an amount equal to the (i) benefit of any
first category tax deduction that has been obtained from CMM from the

Company arising from the Initial Contributions attributed to the Series B
Shareholder or its Affiliates, provided that such Series B Shareholder shall
bear the burden of any disallowance of such deduction, plus (ii) interest on
such amount equal to the amount of interest paid by Banco de Chile for time
deposits in dollars, from the time such deduction is taken by the Company
until the time it is paid.

(3) The Cash Available for Distribution to a Series of Shares
shall be increased by the amount of the benefit of the first category tax
deduction obtained by CMM resulting from any interest expense deduction
taken by CMM with respect to any interest payments made to the holder of
such Series of Shares or an Affiliate thereof, and decreased by the amount of
any stamp tax paid by the Company in connection therewith. Each Series of
Shares shall be responsible for any withholding tax payable by the Company
in connection with any payment made to such Series of Shares or to a
qualified financial institution on behalf of such Series of Shares.

(4) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either
Series of Shares from any withholding or other taxes on any funds distributed
to or on behalf of such Shares, all of which will be borne by that Series of
Shares and adjusted in the Cash Available for Distribution otherwise payable
to such Shares. Any payments of Cash Available for Distribution to the
Shareholders shall be expressly subject and subordinate to any Project

have the right to acquire, for a nominal price, the Buffer Zone Property
except that area which contains a geologically contiguous extension of
mineralization originating within the mining claims included in the Refugio
Property;

B. The Company shall have the right to exploit mineralization
within the Buffer Zone Property which is a geologically contiguous extension
of the mineralization originating within the mining claims included in the
Refugio Property; otherwise, may not exploit mineralization contained within
the Buffer Zone Property;

C. San Damian will have no right to exploit mineralization
within the Buffer Zone Property;

D. The Company will have the use of the surface land of the

Section 15.2 Outside Property. San Damian will hold its interest
----------------
in the Outside Property subject only to the conditions that:

A. If the Company reasonably requests a mining easement or
surface and subsurface rights on a part of the Outside Property on which to
locate facilities to carry out Operations, San Damian shall transfer the same to
the Company provided that:

(1) With respect to facilities not shown in the Project
Feasibility Study, the Company first undertakes, where appropriate and at its
cost, condemnation drilling on the portion of the Outside Property to be
covered by such facilities. Such condemnation drilling shall be conducted to
determine if economic ore resources are contained within the area of the
planned facilities. The scope of the condemnation drilling shall be one hole
per two hectares (with a minimum of one hole per planned facility) to a depth
of at least 100 meters. If economic ore is discovered or if the planned facility
would adversely affect San Damian's ability to exploit previously discovered ore
in the immediate vicinity, the Company will use reasonable efforts to relocate
the planned facilities. Condemnation drilling will not be required or considered
appropriate for roads, pipelines, powerlines, temporary storage areas, tunnels,
temporary uses, ditches, conveyor ways, or for other like facilities, or for
facilities shown on the Project Feasibility Study.

(2) With respect to facilities contemplated by the Project
Feasibility Study, the Company shall be deemed thereby to have requested a
transfer of the properties relating to such facilities, which properties shall
be conveyed to the Company promptly after the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by the 1992 Purchase Agreement.

Subject to condemnation drilling and other on-site considerations,
the current best estimate of the location of the permanent mancamp for the
Verde mining operations is an area of 6 to 12 hectares, more or less, located
within a radius of 600 meters from the following coordinates:

N 6,953,300 m
E 478,350 m

The actual final location of the Verde mancamp will be determined by the
Company during detailed engineering.

San Damian will grant to the Company a mining easement or right
of way encompassing the surface and undersurface of the estimated area and
location of the mancamp, such easement or right of way to be amended, if
necessary, when the actual location and area of the mancamp has been
determined by the Company and condemnation drilling (not to exceed three
holes at a maximum total cost of U.S. $30,000) has been completed.

B. If San Damian wishes to exploit mineralization within the
Outside Property and that mineralization is lying under or within surface or
subsurface rights within which the Company has constructed or has plans to
construct roads, pipelines, powerlines or

-48-

<PAGE>
other facilities for the Refugio
Project, or if CMM has constructed or has plans to construct roads, pipelines,
powerlines or other facilities for the Refugio Project that adversely affect
Newco's ability to exploit ore in the immediate vicinity of such facilities, San
Damian may, when the same will reasonably be needed by San Damian, request
that the Company transfer to San Damian the required portion of the surface
and subsurface rights of the Outside Property and, provided San Damian
bears all costs to the Company of relocating the roads, pipelines, powerlines
or other facilities located on that portion of the Outside Property, which costs
are to include any additional operating costs or lost production costs to the
Company as a result of such relocation, the Company shall transfer to San
Damian the surface and undersurface rights so requested by San Damian,
unless by so doing the Company is unable to continue operations or
production at the anticipated levels then in existence or as contemplated by
the Project Feasibility Study and San Damian is unable to compensate therefor,
such transfer to be made within a reasonable time when San Damian will
actually need such areas.

Section 15.3 Water Rights. Bema Chile has agreed to grant to the
------------
Company in the Agreement an option to acquire all of Bema Chile's interest in
and to the Water Rights. At San Damian's request, the Company will make
available to San Damian such portion of the water supply from the Water
Rights which is in excess of the present and reasonably anticipated future
needs of the Company, at San Damian's cost and for such time as such
supplies are in excess of the Company's needs, for use by San Damian in
exploiting its property and interests in the Outside Property, subject to the
consents of third parties and to compliance with law.

San Damian will be obligated, on request by the Company and at
the Company's cost, to apply for any additional rights within the Outside
Property that may become necessary for Operations.

Section 15.4 Conflicts in Use of Lands. All parties will use
-------------------------
reasonable efforts to reduce potential conflicts in uses with respect to the
Refugio Property, Buffer Zone Property and the Outside Property.

It is agreed by the parties that in the event of any arbitration of
the matters herein, the arbitrator will be governed by the principle of the
best interests of the exploitation of the Refugio Property, as the paramount
interest in the event of incompatibility between exploitation by San Damian and
the Company or in the allocation of rights hereunder.

It is understood that none of AGI, AGRI, Bema, CMR, San Damian or
any of their Affiliates will, other than as set out herein, acquire, claim or
attempt to claim any interests in real or personal property within the Refugio
Property or contrary to the interests of the Company in the Buffer Zone
Property. Any interest so acquired shall, upon demand by the Company, be
immediately conveyed to the Company without charge.

Bema Chile agrees to cause San Damian to comply with its
obligations herein to the extent it is able to do so.

Documents, shall have fifteen (15) days from the date such notice is delivered
to notify the Board whether it elects to acquire the offered interest at the
same price and on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the notice
(or their monetary equivalent). If it does so elect, the transaction shall be
consummated promptly after notice of such election is delivered to the Board.

B. If the Series A Shareholder fails to elect to exercise its
preemptive purchase right within the period provided for in Section 15.5A, the
Series B Shareholder, provided it is not in default under any material
provision of the Bylaws, this Agreement or the Project Financing Documents,
shall have fifteen (15) days from the last day of the fifteen (15) day period
described in Section 15.5A to notify the Board whether it elects to acquire the
offered interest at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as
set forth in the notice (or their monetary equivalent). If it does so elect, the
transaction shall be consummated promptly after notice of such election is
delivered to the Board.

C. If both the Series A Shareholder and the Series B
Shareholder fail to elect to exercise their preemptive purchase rights within
the periods provided for in Section 15.5, the Company shall have 180 days

a third party at a price and on terms no less favorable than those in the
notice required by Section 15.5A.

D. If the Company fails to consummate the sale to a third party
within the period set forth in Section 15.5C, the preemptive right of the
Shareholders in such offered interest shall be deemed to be revived. Any
subsequent proposal to sell such interest shall be conducted in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 15.5.

------------------------------------
may authorize the surrender or abandonment of part or all of the Refugio
Project Properties. If the Board authorizes any such surrender or
abandonment it shall, on and subject to the terms herein provided, offer to
assign such property first to the Series A Shareholder, and if such offer is
not accepted, second to the Series B Shareholder, and if such offer is not
accepted, third to any other entity which has an express contractual right to
receive such offer pursuant to an agreement executed by or enter with the
consent of the Series A and the Series B

Shareholders. A party which receives an offer of assignment of property pursuant
to this Section 15.6 may accept such offer only by notifying the Board of its
acceptance within 10 days after receipt of the offer of assignment. Failure to
notify the Board of acceptance of the offer of assignment within such 10 day
period shall conclusively be deemed to be an irrevocable rejection of such offer
and a waiver of any rights pursuant to this Section 15.6 with respect to the
property subject to the offer. If a party (an "Accepting Assignee") timely
accepts an offer of assignment made pursuant to this Section 15.6: (i) the
Company shall assign to the Accepting Assignee, by quitclaim deed or its
equivalent, all of the Company's interest in the property to be abandoned or
surrendered, (ii) the abandoned or surrendered property shall cease to be part
of the Refugio Project Properties, and (iii) neither the Company nor the other

Assignee from or in connection with the abandoned or surrendered property
(including any such matter based on a condition of the property at the time of
transfer).

surviving entity shall own, immediately after such Transfer, substantially all
of the assets and obligations of that Shareholder, provided further that any

public distribution of ownership interest in the Shareholder or an Affiliate of
the Shareholder; or

Section 19.5 Governing Law. Because of the multinational
-------------
character of the ownership of the Shares and of the Operations to be

certainty that this Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of a center for mining and international mining
activities which is acceptable to them. This Agreement shall be governed by
and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Colorado, the place at which
the majority of negotiations concerning this Agreement occurred, except for its
laws relating to choice of laws. AGRI and Bema Bermuda acknowledge that their
rights and obligations with respect to the Company, an entity formed under
the Mining code of Chile, can be established by contract, as set forth in this
Agreement, and intend that the law of Colorado concerning contracts, rather
than the law of Colorado applicable to a Colorado corporation, partnership or
joint venture, will be applicable to any dispute or controversy arising under
or in connection with this Agreement.

Section 19.6 Further Assurances. Each of the Shareholders
------------------
agrees to take, and to cause the directors of the Company elected by it and
the members of the Technical Management Committee appointed by those

instruments as may be reasonably necessary or convenient to implement and
carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement.

severable; this Agreement and the Bylaws shall be construed and enforced as
if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision formed no part of this
Agreement or the Bylaws; and the remainder of this Agreement or the Bylaws
shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by such
provision or by its severance from this Agreement or the Bylaws, as the case
may be. In lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall

such provision was severed a provision as similar in terms and economic effect
to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be
legal, valid and enforceable.

Section 19.10 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding
--------------
upon and inure to the benefit of the Shareholders hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

Section 19.12 English Language Version Controlling. Because

English is the language of the fora selected by the Shareholders arbitration
and litigation in Sections 17.2 and 17.7 of this Agreement and the law of
Colorado is to govern such proceedings, the English language version of this
Agreement shall control the rights and obligations of the Shareholders
hereunder, and as such it shall be binding as the text of the Shareholders
Agreement on all such parties and on the arbitrator, the finder of fact and
the court, as the case may be, in any litigation conducted pursuant to Section
