OMAHA, NEBRASKA, March 1, 1994 -- California Energy Company, Inc. (NYSE,

Exchange Commission of an S-3 Registration Statement for the planned offering
in March of its Senior Discount Notes due 2004. The Company intends to raise

fund equity investments in, and loans to, other potential international and
domestic private power projects and related facilities, (iii) for corporate
or project acquisitions permitted under the proposed Indenture and (iv) for
other general corporate purposes. The Company would intend that, as project
loans are repaid, the Company may use the proceeds again for any of such
uses.

The Company intends to offer the Senior Discount Notes through an
underwriting group managed by Lehman Brothers Inc., Salomon Brothers Inc.,
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation and Bear, Stearns & Co.,
Inc.

A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective. 
These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to
the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release
shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to
buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any State in which
such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or
qualification under the securities laws of any such State.
