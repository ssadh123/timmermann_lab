</TABLE>

(a) Based on a 10% discount factor on the estimated present value of future
operating lease payments.

(b) Safeway's earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges for the first
quarter of 1993 primarily due to a $50 million charge to operating and
administrative expense for estimated severance payments to be made to
retail employees in the Alberta, Canada division as part of a voluntary
employee buyout. The additional amount of earnings needed to cover fixed
charges in the first quarter of 1993 was $19.7 million.

(c) Safeway's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1993 was adversely
affected by a $54.9 million charge to operating and administrative expense
for severance payments to be made to retail employees in the Alberta,
Canada division as part of a voluntary employee buyout. Excluding this
charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1993 would have been
1.66.

(d) Safeway's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1991 was adversely
affected by a $115 million charge to operating profit in connection with
the bankruptcy of AppleTree Markets, Inc. ("AppleTree"). The $115 million
charge was an estimate of the eventual net lease and related cash payments
which Safeway expected to make over a period of up to 16 years in
connection with any liability Safeway may have on the leases assigned to
AppleTree as part of the sale of the Company's former Houston division.
Excluding this charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1991
would have been 1.44.
