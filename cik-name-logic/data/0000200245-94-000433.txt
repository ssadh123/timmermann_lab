Item 5. Other Events

End-User Utilization of Derivatives

The vast majority of the Company's derivatives use involves
market making activities for customers and the
execution of proprietary trading strategies that include
derivatives. These derivatives are recorded at market or
fair
value in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Financial
Condition with changes in market or fair value
included currently in the Company's Statement of Income.

In addition to its derivatives trading activity, the Company
utilizes interest rate swaps and interest rate futures
contracts to effectively convert fixed-rate term debt and
preferred stock to variable-rate obligations. Further, the
Company utilizes currency swaps and forwards to effectively
convert non-U.S. dollar denominated term debt to
U.S. dollar denominated obligations and currency forwards to
hedge certain investments in subsidiaries with
functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Interest rate swaps used to convert the Company's fixed-rate
obligations to variable rates are recorded "off-balance-
sheet", with net cash inflows or outflows recorded as
adjustments to interest expense or dividends, as
appropriate.
Adjustments to dividends are recorded on an aftertax basis.
Gains and losses on futures contracts are deferred and
amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the
remaining term of the debt instruments being hedged. 
The net deferral is included in Options and contractual
commitments in the Company's Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Condition.
See Term Debt for a further discussion of interest rate swaps
and futures contracts.

Non-U.S. dollar denominated debt issued by Salomon Inc
(Parent Company) is translated to U.S. dollars at
exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting
period. For debt specifically identified as a hedge of an
investment in a subsidiary with a functional currency other
that the U.S. dollar, the translation impact is included
in Cumulative Translation Adjustments in Stockholders'
equity. Such debt represents the majority of Salomon Inc
(Parent Company) non-U.S. dollar denominated term debt. The
impact of translating remaining non-U.S. dollar
term debt to U.S. dollars is included in earnings. The
Company mitigates this exposure by entering into forward
currency purchase agreements. The impact of marking such
agreements to prevailing exchange rates is also
included in earnings. The Company also enters into forward currency 
sales contracts to hedge investments in subsidiaries 
with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
The impact of marking such contracts to prevailing exchange 
rates is included in Cumulative Translation Adjustments in
Stockholders' equity, as is the impact of translating the
investments being hedged.

Term Debt

Conversion of Non-U.S. Dollar Term Debt to U.S. Dollar
Denominated Obligations

At December 31, 1993, consolidated term debt (both fixed-
rate and variable-rate) denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar totaled $2.1 billion. Of this amount,
$1.0 billion was issued by subsidiaries of the Company,
primarily Salomon Brothers AG ("SBAG") in Frankfurt and
Salomon Brothers Asia Limited ("SBAL") in Tokyo.
At December 31, 1993, SBAG had $779 million of term debt outstanding
and SBAL had $215 million of term debt
outstanding. With minimal exceptions, the debt was
denominated in the local currencies of these entities, German
marks for SBAG and Japanese yen for SBAL, which are also the
functional currencies of these entities. The debt
finances operating activities of these subsidiaries and,
consequently, is not converted to U.S. dollars.

Salomon Inc (Parent Company) term debt denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar totaled $1.1 billion
at December 31, 1993. Of this amount, $75 million was
converted to U.S. dollar denominated obligations through
forward currency contracts and swaps. The maturity
structure of such debt at December 31, 1993 was as follows:
$2 million in 1995, $15 million in 1996 and $58 million in
1997. The majority of the remaining Salomon Inc
(Parent Company) non-U.S. dollar term debt not converted to
U.S. dollars, primarily yen denominated debt, was
designated as a hedge of the Company's investments in
certain subsidiaries with functional currencies other than
the
U.S. dollar, primarily SBAL.

Conversion of Fixed-Rate Term Debt to Variable-Rate
Obligations

At December 31, 1993, consolidated fixed-rate term debt
totaled $8.2 billion. The Company utilizes interest rate swap
agreements and interest rate futures contracts to
convert most of its fixed-rate term debt to variable-rate
obligations. Term debt with longer original maturities
is typically hedged with interest rate swap agreements 
while term debt with shorter original maturities is typically
hedged with interest rate futures contracts. 
For debt hedged with interest rate futures contracts, interest 
expense is recorded at a
variable market rate of interest and the difference between
changes in the market value of the debt and the market
value of the futures contracts is recorded in income
currently. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 80 ("SFAS 80"), such difference is not recorded.
Although this approach is not in strict accordance
with SFAS 80,
the resulting difference is not material.
Results obtained under this approach approximate
the results that would be obtained if the
debt was hedged with interest rate swap agreements.
Commencing in the 1994 fourth quarter, the Company ceased
using interest rate futures contracts to hedge its fixed-rate 
debt and now uses interest rate swap
agreements, regardless of maturity.

The following table summarizes the Company's fixed-rate
obligations at December 31, 1993, which were
effectively converted to variable-rate obligations through
interest rate swap agreements, under which the Company
receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate.
The maturity structure of the swap contracts is structured
to correspond with the maturity structure of the debt being
hedged.

============================================================================
</TABLE>
The U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate
obligations swapped to variable in the
preceding table are Salomon Inc
(Parent Company) obligations. The variable
rates paid by the Company under the swap
agreements are typically
three to six month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus a
spread that averages 75 basis points. The
remaining Salomon Inc
(Parent Company) U.S. dollar denominated
fixed-rate term debt of $3.4 billion at
December 31, 1993 was
effectively converted to variable-rate debt
through the use of interest rate futures
contracts. The variable rate obtained under this approach
is approximately the same as that obtained using interest
rate swap agreements. The maturity structure of the futures
contracts corresponds with the maturity structure of the 
debt being hedged.

The Company's non-U.S. dollar fixed-rate term
debt of $1.4 billion at December 31, 1993 was
issued across a
broad range of currencies (including German
marks, Japanese yen, U.K. sterling, Italian
lire, Swedish krone, and
European Currency Units) and, consequently, a
wide range of interest rates, from less than
5% for certain yen
denominated issues to more than 12% for
certain lire denominated issues. SBAG had
nearly $700 million of fixed-
rate mark denominated term debt outstanding
at December 31, 1993, with a weighted average
fixed interest rate of
8.5%. SBAG converted a substantial majority
of this debt to a variable rate, typically
one month mark LIBOR
which was 6.2% at December 31, 1993.
Similarly, Salomon Inc (Parent Company) and
SBAL converted
approximately $450 million of yen denominated
term debt, with a weighted average fixed rate
of 4.8%, to variable
rates determined by one or three month yen
LIBOR plus a spread. The weighted average
variable rate was 3.1% at
December 31, 1993.

The Company has no deferred gains or losses
as a result of the termination of interest
rate swap agreements.
