ITEM 3. BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP

(a) Not applicable.

(b) An order confirming the Third Amended Plan of
Reorganization, as Modified (the "Plan") has been
entered by a court having jurisdiction over
substantially all of the assets and business of
Commonwealth Equity Trust (the "Company").

i) The Plan was confirmed and an order entered
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern
District of California (Sacramento Division).

ii) The order confirming the Plan was entered by
the Bankruptcy Court on August 8, 1994.

iii) The following is a summary of the material
features of the Plan. Capitalized terms used
in the summary but not defined shall have the
meaning given for such terms in the Plan. A
copy of the Plan is attached hereto as
described in Item 7(a) below.

I. OVERVIEW OF THE PLAN

Pursuant to the terms of the Plan,
Reorganized CET will emerge from
Chapter 11 and retain almost all of
its properties and assets.
Virtually all of the Company's
creditors will have their debts
restructured. The Pacific Mutual
Lenders have an Allowed Claim for
$79,000,000. Under the Plan, the
Pacific Mutual Lenders will receive
secured notes in the amount of
$40,000,000 and New CET Preferred
Stock of $22,500,000.

Reorganized CET will issue about
5,000 shares of New CET Common
Stock. About 2,550,000 shares (or
51%) of New CET Common Stock will be
distributed to the Pacific Mutual
Lenders. About 2,450,000 shares (or
49%) will be available for holders
of Old CET Common Stock and those
persons who formerly owned Old CET
Common Stock and have an Allowed
Claim for damages from the purchase
and sale of the stock (Classes
17(a), 17(b), 18(a), and 18(b)).

2
<PAGE> 3
There are currently about 
25,000,000 shares of Old CET Common Stock
outstanding, which shares are held
by about 29,000 shareholders. The
Plan will have the effect of an
approximately 10 for 1 reverse stock
split, that is, for approximately
every 10 shares of Old CET Common
Stock, a person will receive 1 share
of New CET Common Stock.

Persons who hold 1,000 shares or less
of Old CET Common Stock may elect to
receive $.20 cash for each share of
Old CET Common Stock. Persons who
hold more than 1,000 shares of Old
CET Common Stock may not elect to
receive cash and must accept New CET
Common Stock in exchange for their
existing shares.

Each shareholder must return to the
Stock Transfer Agent his or her Old
CET Common Stock within one year
after the Effective Date of the Plan
or be forever barred from receiving
a distribution under the Plan. The
Plan will take effect on October 1,
1994.

The initial Board of Trustees of
Reorganized CET will have 5 members,
each of whom will hold office for
one year, and each of whom will be
elected as follows: 1 member will
be selected by the holders of the
New CET Preferred Stock (initially,
the Pacific Mutual Lenders); 1
member will be Frank Morrow, as
elected by the Company; and 3
members will be selected by a
selection committee. Except for
Frank Morrow, no member of the Board
may be a past or present employee,
trustee, director, or member of the
Pacific Mutual Lenders, any
Committee in the Chapter 11 case, or
the Company. The selection
committee includes 1 representative
from the Equity Security Holders'
Committee, 2 representatives from
the Pacific Mutual Lenders and Frank
Morrow (as a non-voting
representative).

After the first year, the Board of
Trustees of Reorganized CET will be
selected as follows: 1 member will
be

3
<PAGE> 4
elected by the holders of New CET 
Preferred Stock, and 4 members will be 
elected by the holders of New CET Common 
Stock.

II. HOW THE PLAN WILL WORK FOR CURRENT
AND FORMER CET SHAREHOLDERS

A. Selected Plan 
Definitions. 
Old CET Common Stock: All common stock
and trust shares of the Company which 
were issued and outstanding or authorized
prior to August 8, 1994.

Old CET Securities: All warrants,
options, trust certificates or other
equity securities of the Company which
were issued and outstanding or 
authorized prior to August 8, 1994, 
other than the Old CET Common Stock.

Old CET Common Stock Record Date: 
June 9, 1994, the date established by the
Bankruptcy Court for determining the
record owners of Old CET Common Stock for
purposes of voting on, and receiving
distributions under, the Plan.

B. Classification of Current and 
Former CET Shareholders. 

The Plan divides current and former
shareholders of the Company into the
following four classes:

Class 17 (a) (Claims By Former CET
Shareholders): This class includes
every Allowed Claim arising from a 
request for rescission of a purchase or
sale of Old CET Common Stock or for 
damages arising from such a purchase or
sale, or for reimbursement or 
contribution, which claim is held by a 
person who does not own, as of the Old 
CET Common Stock Record Date, the Old

4
<PAGE> 5
CET Common Stock which forms the 
basis of such claim.

Class 17 (b) (Claims By Current CET
Shareholders): This class includes 
every Allowed Claim arising from a 
request for the rescission of a purchase
or sale of Old CET Common Stock or for 
damages arising from such a purchase or
sale, or for reimbursement or
contribution, which claim is held by a
person who owns, as of the Old CET
Common Stock Record Date, the Old CET
Common Stock which forms the basis of
such claim.

Class 18(a): This class consists of
those persons who hold 1,000 or less
shares of Old CET Common Stock on the
Old CET Common Stock Record Date. 

Class 18(b): This class consists of
those persons who hold more than 1,000 
shares of Old CET Common Stock on the 
Old Common Stock Record Date.

C. Treatment of Current and Former CET
Shareholders: 

Class 18(a): Distributions to persons
holding 200 or less shares of Old CET
Common Stock: Except as provided in
Section G below, each person in Class
18(a) who holds no more than 200 shares
of Old CET Common Stock will receive
$.20 per share for each share of his or
her Old CET Common Stock, unless the
person elects by ballot to receive a pro
rata distribution of New CET Common
Stock instead of cash.

Class 18(a): Distributions to persons
holding between 201 and 1,000 shares of
Old CET Common Stock: Each person in
Class 18(a) who holds between 201 and
1,000 shares of Old CET Common Stock
will receive a pro rata distribution of

5
<PAGE> 6
New CET Common Stock, unless the
person elects by ballot to receive
$.20 per share for each share of
his or her Old CET Common Stock
instead of and in lieu of the New
CET Common Stock.

Class 18(b): Each person in Class
18(b) who holds more than
1,000 shares of Old CET
Common Stock will receive a
pro rata distribution of New
CET Common Stock.

Class 17(a): The Plan provides that
every Allowed Claim in Class
17(a) will be subordinated to
creditors and will have the
same priority as the holders
of Old CET Common Stock in
Classes 18(a) and 18(b).
Persons in Class 17(a) will
receive distributions of cash
or New CET Common Stock
calculated on the same basis
as distributions of cash or
New CET Common Stock made to
the shareholders in Classes
18(a) and 18(b). Each
distribution to Class 17(a)
will be based on the number
of shares of Old CET Common
Stock involved in the
purchase or sale transaction
which is the basis of the
alleged claim, without regard
to the dollar amount of
damages, if any, alleged in
such claim.

Class 17(b): Every Allowed Claim in
Class 17(b) will be
subordinated to creditors and
will have the same priority
as the holders of Old CET
Common Stock in Classes 18(a)
and 18(b). Persons in Class
17(a) will receive
distributions of cash or New
CET Common Stock calculated
on the same basis as
distributions of cash or New
CET Common Stock made to
shareholders in Classes 18(a)
or 18(b). However, only one
distribution will be made on
account of each share of Old
CET Common Stock with respect
to which the same person
asserts both a Class 17(b)
claim and a Class 18(a)

6
<PAGE> 7
or 18(b) equity interest. Each
distribution to Class 17(b)
will be based on the number
of shares of Old CET Common
Stock involved in the
purchase or sale transaction
underlying the claim, without
regard to the dollar amount
of damages, if any, alleged
in the claim.

D. Number of Shares of New CET
Common Stock To Be
Distributed. The formula for
calculating the number of
shares to be issued is
somewhat complicated.
However, the number of shares
of New CET Common Stock to be
distributed to each person in
Classes 17(a), 17(b), 18(a)
or 18(b) is expected to be
about 1 share of New CET
Common Stock for every 10
shares of Old CET Common
Stock. The shares of New CET
Common Stock ultimately held
by Classes 17(a), 17(b),
18(a) and 18(b) may be less
than 49% of the total, after
giving effect to the cash
redemptions.

E. Cash Payments. Any cash
payments to the persons in
Classes 17(a), 17(b) or 18(a)
may or may not be made, at
the option of the Plan
proponents, depending on the
cash requirements of
Reorganized CET on the
Effective Date of the Plan.
In the event any person in
Classes 17(a), 17(b) or 18(a)
does not receive the cash
payment which he or she
elected, each such person
will receive instead a pro
rata distribution of New CET
Common Stock.

F. No Distribution of Fractional
Shares or Dollars. All
distributions of cash will be
rounded up or down to the
nearest whole dollar and all
distributions of New CET
Common Stock will be rounded
up or down to the nearest
whole number of shares.

7
<PAGE> 8
G. No De Minimis Distribution.
Pursuant to Rule 3010 of the
Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure, there will be no
distribution to persons in
Classes 17(a), 17(b) or 18(a)
if the claim or interest is
based on less than 25 shares
of Old CET Common Stock or
would result in less than a
$5.00 distribution. This is
to protect Reorganized CET
from the administrative
burden of accounting for and
processing minimal amounts
for which the cost to
Reorganized CET is likely to
exceed the benefit to the
present or former
shareholder. The value of
the New CET Common Stock
would hardly be in excess of
postage costs alone, and the
cost of trading or servicing
small share amounts would not
be economical to the
shareholders.

H. Cancellation of Old CET Common
Stock. All Old CET Common
Stock and old CET securities
will be cancelled and
terminated under the Plan.
Any person in Classes 18(a),
18(b) or 17(b) who does not
submit his or her original
certificates of Old CET
Common Stock to Reorganized
CET's Stock Transfer Agent
within one year of the
Effective Date of the Plan
will forfeit the right to
receive any cash redemption
or any New CET Common Stock
under the Plan.

(4) The Company has 25,093,426 shares of common
stock outstanding. Pursuant to the terms of
the Plan, all outstanding shares of common
stock will be terminated and cancelled, and
approximately 2,450,000 shares of new common
stock issued in its place. In addition,
2,550,000 shares of new common stock, and
11,250,000 shares of preferred stock,
representing 100% of the Company's preferred
stock, will be issued to the Pacific Mutual
Lenders.

B. TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS:
-------------------------------------------------

1. CLASS 2 CLAIM: LENDERS' CLAIM. Under the Plan the
Lenders will receive the Lenders' Restructured Secured Notes, the Lenders'
Restructured Documents, New CET Preferred Stock and New CET Common Stock in
full satisfaction of the Lenders' Claim. In addition, the Lenders' Litigation
will be dismissed with prejudice and the Lenders and CET will execute mutual
general releases, as set forth in Article VIII.G. hereof. The Lenders' Claim
will receive the following treatment under the plan:

a. ALLOWANCE OF LENDERS' CLAIMS. Lenders' Claim
shall be allowed in the aggregate amount of Seventy- Nine Million Dollars
($79,000,000). Confirmation of the Plan shall be deemed to be a finding of
fact and a judgment that the value of the Lenders' prepetition collateral
equals at least $79,000,000 and that all Claims in Class 2 are Allowed Claims
which are fully secured under Code section 506(a).

b. LENDERS' RESTRUCTURED SECURED NOTES. On the
Effective Date, each of the Lenders shall receive a Pro Rata Distribution of
the Lenders' Restructured Secured Notes which shall be issued by Reorganized
CET. The Lenders' Restructured Secured Notes shall be in the aggregate
original principal amount

29
<PAGE> 35
of Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000). The Lenders' Restructured Secured
Notes shall be issued pursuant to the Lenders' Restructured Loan Documents and
shall have the terms summarized in Exhibit "A" hereto. The Lenders'
Restructured Secured Notes shall be secured by all now existing and hereafter
arising real property and personal property of Reorganized CET, save and except
for the After Acquired Property (as defined in Exhibit "A"), to the extent
provided and under the terms and conditions set forth in the Lenders'
Restructured Loan Documents and in Exhibit "A". The liens and security
interests securing the Lenders' Claim and Lender Loans which existed as of the
Petition Date shall be retained, shall have the same priority they had as of
the Petition Date, and shall secure the Lenders' Restructured Secured Notes.
The Lenders' Restructured Secured Notes and the Lenders' Restructured Loan
Documents shall constitute an amendment and restatement in their entirety of
all notes, agreements, and obligations which gave rise to the Lenders' Claim.
The liens retained by and granted to the holders of the Lenders' Restructured
Secured Notes shall be junior and subordinate to the liens and security
interests granted to secure the New Credit Line and the Redding Hotel
Improvement Loan. Notwithstanding the retention and granting of liens in favor
of the Lenders, Reorganized CET shall be free (subject to the conditions in the
Lenders' Restructured Secured Notes and the Lenders' Restructured Loan
Documents) to use and dispose of all property of the Estate to consummate the
Plan and operate its business after Confirmation.

c. NEW CET COMMON STOCK. Each of the Lenders
shall receive a Pro Rata distribution of Two Million Five Hundred Fifty
Thousand (2,550,000) shares of New CET Common Stock. The shares of New CET
Common Stock distributed to Lenders shall be subject to the Registration Rights
Agreement summarized on Exhibit C hereto and shall be subject to the securities
provisions of Article VI.J of this Plan. Reorganized CET shall be a party to
the Registration Rights Agreement.

The Distribution of shares of New CET Common
Stock provided under the Plan may mathematically entitle the holder of an
Allowed Claim in Class 2 to a fractional share of New CET Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, only whole numbers of shares of New CET Common
Stock will be issued and distributed. When a Distribution on account of an
Allowed Claim in Class 2 would otherwise result in the issuance of a number of
shares of New CET Common Stock, unless redeemed, that is not a whole number,
the shares so distributed shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

d. NEW CET PREFERRED STOCK. Each of the Lenders
shall receive a Pro Rata Distribution of New CET Preferred Stock, which shall
have an initial stated value as of the Effective Date of Twenty Two Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars

30
<PAGE> 36
($22,500,000), and shall have the terms summarized on Exhibit B attached
hereto. The New CET Preferred Stock may be converted into New CET Common
Stock, unless redeemed, on the terms and conditions summarized in Exhibit B
hereto.

e. RELEASE OF LENDERS LITIGATION. The Lenders
Litigation shall be dismissed with prejudice, in accordance with the terms of
Article VIII.G. of the Plan.

a. The holder of said Allowed Claim secured by a
Senior Mortgage shall retain its lien upon and security interest in all real
and personal property collateral granted to secure said Allowed Claim, which
lien and security interest shall have the same priority it had as of the
Petition Date, to the extent said lien and security interest was either (i)
valid, perfected, and not avoidable as of the Petition Date, or (ii) granted
pursuant to a Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court as a form of adequate
protection for continuation of the stay or for use of collateral or cash
collateral.

b. The Claim in said class shall be an Allowed
Claim in the amount of: (i) all principal owed as of the Effective Date; (ii)
all fees and interest accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Date, at the rate
provided for in the agreements under which said Claim arose to the extent such
fees and interest are allowed by the Bankruptcy Court; provided that the
interest rate and fees shall be calculated at the pre-default rate set forth in
said agreements and shall not include any penalties, premium rates, late fees,
default interest, or charges arising solely because of default; and (iii) all
professional fees and costs provided for in the agreements under which said
Claim arose, but only to the extent there is either (a) a stipulation of the
Proponents and said Claim holder to allow such fees and costs, subject to the
Court's approval of said stipulation, or (b) a Final Order of the Bankruptcy
Court determining that such professional fees and costs are reasonable.

c. The Proponents shall seek from the Court a
finding of fact and an order that the value of the real property and personal
property liens and security interests securing said Allowed Claim equals at
least the amount of the principal, interest, fees and other charges of the
Allowed Claim as determined under subparagraph 2.b. hereof and that the Allowed

31
<PAGE> 37
Claim in said class is fully secured under Code sections 506(a) and 506(b).

d. The applicable Restructured Secured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust or security instrument shall be deemed to be in full
satisfaction of all Allowed Claims asserted by the holder thereof, including,
but not limited to, any Administrative Claim and any Priority Unsecured Claim
allowable under Code sections 503 or 507 arising in connection with this
Chapter 11 case, including Claims on account of the Debtor's use of collateral
or cash collateral or continuation of the automatic stay.

e. All debt instruments and agreements under
which said Claim arises (including but not limited to recorded deeds of trust,
fixtures filings and rent assignments, and filed UCC financing statements)
shall remain in effect, except to the extent amended and superseded by the
applicable Restructured Secured Note and Restructured Deed of Trust, which
shall be issued by Reorganized CET in recordable form on the Effective Date in
a form which shall be filed with the Court prior to the Effective Date, under
which:

(1) all principal, interest, fees,
professional fees and charges of the Allowed Claim accrued but unpaid as of the
Effective Date (subject to paragraph 2.b. above) shall constitute the principal
indebtedness of the Restructured Secured Note and Restructured Deed of Trust;

(2) there shall be no late fees provided
for in the Restructured Secured Note and default interest at the rate of two
percent (2%) per annum in excess of the contract rate under the applicable
Restructured Secured Note shall be charged only on the installment of principal
or interest not paid when due from and after the Effective Date;

(3) there shall be no financial
covenants or other covenants except the duty to maintain the property and pay
taxes and insurance;

(4) the existence of the junior liens on
the collateral authorized by this Plan to secure the Lenders' Restructured
Notes, the New Credit Line and the Redding Hotel Improvement Loan, shall not be
an event of default or entitle the holder thereof to accelerate the applicable
Restructured Secured Note;

(5) The Restructured Secured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust shall be without recourse to Reorganized CET;

32
<PAGE> 38
(6) The Restructured Secured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust shall not contain prepayment penalties or any other
provisions which would give rise to a default under the terms of the Plan or
terms which would be inconsistent with the treatment of the particular Allowed
Claim provided for under the Plan;

(7) The Restructured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust shall not contain any due on sale or due on
encumbrance clause; provided, however, that:

(i) each Restructured Note shall
provide for a loan assumption fee for sales (but not for encumbrances) equal to
one percent (1%) for loan amounts up to one million dollars ($1 million) and an
additional one quarter of one percent (1/4%) for all amounts in excess of one
million dollars ($1 million);

(ii) upon sale the Restructured Deed
of Trust shall continue to encumber the subject property in the same priority
as before sale; and

(iii) to the extent the Bankruptcy
Court determines that the Restructured Note is a recourse liability of
Reorganized CET on the Effective Date, and unless this Plan otherwise provides
to the contrary with respect to any Senior Mortgage, the holder of the
Restructured Note and Restructured Deed of Trust may require, as a condition of
sale, that the buyer of the property assume recourse liability for the
Restructured Note. Upon sale, the liability of Reorganized CET under the
Restructured Note and Restructured Deed of Trust would be as provided for under
applicable law and the parties' agreements; and

(8) The Restructured Secured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust shall contain attorneys' fees provisions if, and to
the extent, such provisions are contained in the prepetition debt instruments
and agreements under which a given Claim arises.

f. The proponents may engage in further
negotiations with one or more Senior Mortgagees after the filing of the Plan
and may enter into stipulations which vary the terms of the Restructured Note
or Restructured Deed of Trust from the terms set forth in this Article IV.B.
The Proponents may seek approval and confirmation of such stipulations as
modifications of the Plan which do not require the re-solicitation of
acceptances, except from the particular Senior Mortgagee which is the subject
of such stipulation and Plan modification.

g. The provisions of the Confirmation Order
determining that the Allowed Claim of a Senior Mortgagee is fully

33
<PAGE> 39
secured under 11 U.S.C. Section 506 shall not prejudice the right of such
Senior Mortgagee to prove that a deficiency claim may exist at a later date, to
the extent Reorganized CET has recourse liability.

3. CLASS 3 CLAIM: COMMERCIAL FEDERAL SECURED CLAIM
(REDDING HOTEL). To the extent the provisions of this Article IV.B.3. are
inconsistent with provisions in Article IV.B.2., the provisions of this Article
IV.B.3. shall control. The holder of the Commercial Federal Secured Claim
shall receive the following treatment under the Plan:

a. COMMERCIAL FEDERAL RESTRUCTURED SECURED NOTE.
On the Effective Date, Commercial Federal shall receive the Commercial Federal
Restructured Secured Note. The Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note
shall (i) be in an original principal amount equal to the amount described in
Paragraph IV.B.2.b. hereof; (ii) bear interest at the fixed rate of nine and
five-eighths percent (9-5/8%) per annum on the unpaid principal balance owed
under the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note; and (iii) be due and
payable in full five (5) years after the date of commencement of the operation
of the Redding Hotel under the flag of a national hotel chain. The Commercial
Federal Restructured Secured Note shall not provide Commercial Federal with the
right to "call" the loan on January 1, 1995.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the
Plan to the contrary, Commercial Federal shall be entitled to charge and
collect default interest at the rate of eleven and five-eighths percent (11
5/8%) per annum on the entire amount of the then-outstanding principal balance
of the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note, so long as the note
remains in default.

b. PAYMENTS TO BE MADE DURING FIRST TWO YEARS OF
THE COMMERCIAL FEDERAL RESTRUCTURED SECURED NOTE. For the period which shall
commence on the earlier of the Effective Date or December 1, 1994 and
continuing for two years thereafter, Commercial Federal shall receive interest
only payments on account of the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note.
Interest shall be paid monthly in arrears on the first day of each calendar
month, with the first payment due on the earlier of the first day of the month
following the Effective Date or December 1, 1994. From and after the date of
the first payment due under this paragraph and until such time as the principal
amount of the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note has been determined
pursuant to Paragraph IV.B.2.b. of the Plan, Reorganized CET shall make
interest payments to the holder of the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured
Note based on the principal amount asserted by Commercial Federal in a written
demand made to CET prior to the Effective Date. In the event the principal
balance of the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured

34
<PAGE> 40
Note as determined pursuant to Paragraph IV.B.2.b. of the Plan is less than the
principal balance asserted by Commercial Federal, any excess interest paid to
the holder of the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note by Reorganized
CET by reason of the higher principal balance asserted by Commercial Federal
shall be offset against the next interest payment owing to the holder of the
Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note.

c. PAYMENTS TO BE MADE DURING REMAINING TERM OF
THE COMMERCIAL FEDERAL RESTRUCTURED SECURED NOTE. For the remaining term of
the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note, Commercial Federal shall
receive equal payments of principal and interest, based on a twenty-five (25)
year amortization schedule, on account of the Commercial Federal Restructured
Secured Note. Principal and interest payments shall be paid monthly in arrears
on the first day of the calendar month with the first payment due on the first
day of the twenty-fifth (25th) month following the date of the first interest
payment made to Commercial Federal pursuant to paragraph b. above. The unpaid
principal balance due under the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note,
together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be all due and
payable five (5) years after the date of commencement of the operation of the
Redding Hotel under the flag of a national hotel chain.

d. LIENS. The obligations under the Commercial
Federal Restructured Secured Note shall be secured by the Commercial Federal
Restructured Deed of Trust. The Commercial Federal Restructured Deed of Trust
shall be a first deed of trust encumbering the Redding Hotel. If Reorganized
CET obtains the Redding Hotel Improvement Loan, the lien securing the Redding
Hotel Improvement Loan shall be junior to the Commercial Federal Restructured
Deed of Trust. No junior encumbrances other than those securing the Redding
Hotel Improvement Loan and the Pacific Mutual Lenders' Restructured Secured
Note shall be permitted under the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note
and the Commercial Federal Restructured Deed of Trust.

e. RECOURSE. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Article IV.B.2.e.(5) of the Plan, the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured
Note and the Commercial Federal Restructured Deed of Trust shall be recourse as
to Reorganized CET, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the debt
instruments and agreements under which the Commercial Federal Secured Claim
arises.

f. ASSUMPTION OF LOAN. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, the Commercial Federal Secured
Claim may not be assumed without the written consent of Commercial Federal.

g. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.
-----------------

(1) On or before December 15, 1994, the
Board of Trustees of Reorganized CET shall pass a resolution providing that one
million dollars of funds available in a credit facility (e.g. line of credit,
letter of credit or funds on deposit with a lending institution) shall be
specifically earmarked for the funding of any repair and replacement
requirements under a hotel franchisor/licensor commitment to be obtained with
respect to the Redding Hotel. This deadline may be waived by Commercial
Federal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Reorganized CET shall be obligated to
spend only that amount that is necessary to obtain and fulfill the written
commitment described more fully in Paragraph g.(ii) and (iv) below. Absent a
waiver from Commercial Federal, Reorganized CET's failure to comply with this
deadline shall constitute a non-curable event of default. Thereafter,
Commercial Federal shall be free to commence and conclude a foreclosure sale of
the Redding Hotel property, and exercise any and all other rights and remedies
it may have under the Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note and the
Commercial Federal Restructured Deed of Trust.

(2) On or before January 31, 1995,
Reorganized CET shall obtain a written commitment from the Holiday Inn or other
hotel franchisor/licensor acceptable to Commercial Federal. This deadline may
be waived by Commercial Federal. Commercial Federal shall have the right to
reject any franchise/license which allows lower operating standards than those
existing under the requirements of the Holiday Inn. Commercial Federal agrees
that a full service Ramada, a full service Howard Johnsons and a full service
Clarion are examples of franchises with acceptable operating standards. In the
event that Reorganized CET and Commercial Federal are unable to reach agreement
regarding whether a proposed franchisor/licensor has acceptable operating
standards, the issue shall be decided by the Bankruptcy Court. Absent a waiver
by Commercial Federal, failure of Reorganized CET to comply with the deadlines
set forth in this paragraph shall constitute a non-curable event of default.
Thereafter, Commercial Federal shall be free to commence and conclude a
foreclosure sale of the Redding Hotel property, and exercise any and all other
rights and remedies it may have under the Commercial Federal Restructured
Secured Note and the Commercial Federal Restructured Deed of Trust.

(3) An Event of Default shall occur if,
after Reorganized CET commences operation of the Redding Hotel under the flag
of a national hotel chain, Reorganized CET thereafter loses the right to
operate the Redding Hotel under that flag. If the loss of the flag is through
no fault of Reorganized CET, Reorganized CET shall have a period of six months
after the occurrence of this Event of Default within which to cure the default.
If the loss of the flag is the result of

36
<PAGE> 42
Reorganized CET's failure to comply with the requirements of the national hotel
chain, Commercial Federal shall be free to exercise its rights under the
Commercial Federal Restructured Secured Note and the Commercial Federal
Restructured Deed of Trust and Reorganized CET shall retain its reinstatement
rights under California law.

(4) On or before October 1, 1995,
Reorganized CET shall "raise the flag" of the chosen hotel franchisor/licensor.
If this deadline is missed:

(a) Reorganized CET shall waive its
right to seek to enjoin the enforcement of the default; and

(b) Reorganized CET will agree to
execute a deed in lieu of foreclosure if Commercial Federal so elects. If
Commercial Federal elects to receive a deed in lieu of foreclosure, Commercial
Federal will waive any deficiency claim. If Commercial Federal elects to
receive a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Pacific Mutual Lenders will reconvey
their deed of trust on the Redding Hotel property.

4. CLASS 6(A) CLAIM: SUN LIFE OF AMERICA SECURED CLAIM
#1 -- 425 UNIVERSITY AVENUE. The holder of the Sun Life of America Secured
Claim #1 -- 425 University Avenue shall receive the following treatment under
the Plan: The holder of the Class 6(a) Claim has obtained relief from the
automatic stay. The property which is security for said Claim shall be sold at
foreclosure sale pursuant to applicable state law and in consideration of the
full and final satisfaction of said Claim. The holder of the Sun Life of
America Secured Claim #1 shall retain all legal, equitable and contractual
rights to which it is entitled; provided, that the holder of said claim shall
not be entitled to any General Unsecured Claim against CET or Reorganized CET
and CET reserves all defenses, objections, counterclaims, and offsets with
respect to any such General Unsecured Claim.

5. CLASS 6(B) CLAIM: SUN LIFE OF AMERICA SECURED CLAIM
#2 -- REGENCY PLAZA. All dollar amounts set forth in this Article IV.B.5. are

which has accrued, at the contract non-default rate, from May 1, 1994 through
the Effective Date and which has not been paid during the Chapter 11 Case. On
the Effective Date Sun Life of America shall receive the Sun Life

37
<PAGE> 43

holders of Allowed Equity Interests in Classes 18(a) and 18(b), as described in
Article IV.B.22. and IV.B.23. hereof; provided, however, that the Distribution

as Distributions of Cash or New CET Common Stock made to holders of Allowed
Equity Interests in Classes 18(a) and 18(b), as described in Article IV.B.22.
and IV.B.23. hereof; provided, however, that only one Distribution shall be

that each holder of an Allowed Equity Interest in Class 18(a) or 18(b) shall be
entitled to only a single recovery on account of, in the aggregate, such

Article VI.G. hereof (De Minimis Distributions) and Article IV.B.22.e. hereof,
the following:

(1) DISTRIBUTIONS TO PERSONS HOLDING 200
SHARES OF OLD CET COMMON STOCK OR LESS: In the event that a holder of an
Allowed Equity Interest in Class 18(a) holds no more than two hundred (200)
shares of Old CET Common Stock as of the Old CET Common Stock Record Date, said
holder may receive, on account of his/her shares of Old CET Common Stock,
twenty cents ($0.20) for each share of Old CET Common Stock, and said holder
shall receive no New Common Stock on account of said Allowed Equity Interests,
unless said holder elects on the Ballot to receive said shares of New CET
Common Stock in lieu and instead of Cash, and each holder's Pro Rata
Distribution of New CET Common Stock shall be calculated as set forth in
Article IV.B.22. and IV.B.23. hereof.

54
<PAGE> 60

(2) DISTRIBUTIONS TO PERSONS HOLDING
BETWEEN 201 AND 1000 SHARES OF OLD CET COMMON STOCK: In the event that a
holder of an Allowed Equity Interest in Class 18(a) holds at least two hundred
one (201) shares but not more than one thousand (1,000) shares of Old CET
Common Stock as of the Old CET Common Stock Record Date, said holder shall
receive, on account of his shares of Old CET Common Stock, shares of New CET
Common Stock, and each holder's Pro Rata Distribution shall be calculated as
set forth in Article IV.B.23. hereof, unless said holder elects on the Ballot
to receive Cash equal to twenty cents ($0.20) per Share of said holder's Old
CET Common Stock.

b. CLASS 18(B) ALLOWED EQUITY INTERESTS OF MORE
THAN 1,000 SHARES: Each holder of an Allowed Equity Interest holding as of the
Old CET Common Stock Record Date more than one thousand (1,000) shares of Old
CET Common Stock (Class 18(b)) shall receive, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Date, a Pro Rata Distribution of 2,450,000 shares of New CET Common
Stock; provided the shares of New CET New Common Stock issued to all Allowed
Equity Interests in Class (18(b)) shall be reduced by:

(1) the number of shares of New CET Common 
Stock issued to Persons in Class 18(a);

(2) the number of shares of New CET Common
Stock which would otherwise have been issued to Persons in Class 18(a) whose
shares are redeemed for Cash under Article IV.B.22.a. hereof;

(3) the number of shares of New CET Common
Stock which would otherwise have been issued to Persons in Class 17(a) whose
shares are redeemed for Cash under Article IV.B.21. hereof; and

(4) the number of shares of New CET Common
Stock issued to persons in Class 17(a) under Article IV.B.21. hereof.

c. TREATMENT OF SUBORDINATED CLAIMS BASED ON
CURRENTLY HELD CET COMMON STOCK. Each holder of an Allowed Equity Interest in
Class 18(a) or Class 18(b) shall be entitled to only a single recovery on
account of, in the aggregate, said Allowed Equity Interest and its Allowed
Claim (if any) in Class 17(b) arising out of the purchase or sale of the shares
of Old CET Common Stock represented by said Allowed Equity Interest, which
single recovery shall be based on said Allowed Equity Interest and shall be
limited to such holder's Distribution under this Article IV.B.22.

d. CANCELLATION OF OLD CET SECURITIES; NO
FRACTIONAL SHARES. All Old CET Common Stock and all Old CET

55
<PAGE> 61

Securities shall be canceled and terminated under the Plan as of the Effective
Date. The Distribution of shares of New CET Common Stock provided under the
Plan may mathematically entitle the holder of an Allowed Claim in Classes 17(a)
or 17(b) or an Allowed Equity Interest in Classes 18(a) or 18(b) to a
fractional share of New CET Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only
whole numbers of shares of New CET Common Stock will be issued and distributed.
Fractional shares of New CET Common Stock of one half or greater shall be
rounded up to the next whole number, while fractional shares of New CET Common
Stock of less than one half shall be rounded down to the next whole number.

e. PLAN PROPONENTS OPTION TO MAKE CASH PAYMENT
TO ALLOWED EQUITY INTERESTS CLASS 18(A) AND CLASS 17(A) AND CLASS 17(B) ALLOWED
CLAIMS. Notwithstanding the provisions contained in Article IV.B.21. and
Article IV.B.22.a. which would otherwise entitle holders of Allowed Equity
Interests in Class 18(a) or entitle holders of Allowed Claims in Class 17(a) or
Class 17(b) to receive a Cash payment, any Cash payments shall be made at the
option of the Plan Proponents based upon the Cash requirements of Reorganized
CET on the Effective Date. In the event any holder of an Allowed Equity
Interest in Class 18(a) or holder of an Allowed Claim in Class 17(a) or Class
17(b) does not receive such Cash payments, said holder shall receive
distributions of New CET Common Stock as provided in Article IV.B.22.

23. Number of Shares of New CET Common Stock. The number
of shares of New CET Common Stock to be distributed to each holder of an
Allowed Equity Interest in Class 18(a) or Class 18(b) and to each holder of an
Allowed Claim in Class 17(a) or Class 17(b) shall be calculated as follows:

a. There shall be determined a fraction (the
"Fraction") the (i) numerator of which is the number of shares of Old CET
Common Stock held by said holder in Class 18(a), 18(b), 17(a) or 17(b), and
(ii) denominator of which is the sum of (x) the total number of shares of Old
CET Common Stock outstanding as of the Old CET Common Stock Record Date, plus
(y) the total number of shares of Old CET Common Stock that are the basis of
all Allowed Claims in Class 17(a), less (2) the number of shares of Old CET
Common Stock for which no distribution is made pursuant to Article VI.G.
hereof.

b. The Fraction shall then be multiplied by
2,450,000, to calculate the number of shares to be issued to each holder in
Classes 17(a), 17(b), 18(a) or 18(b).

c. To the extent that the mathematical
functions, such as the calculation of shares under this Article IV.B.23., the
rounding of fractional shares, or the calculations

56
<PAGE> 62

of Pro Rata Shares, result in the issuance of slightly greater or less than
2,550,000 shares of New CET Common Stock to Lenders, or slightly greater or
less than 2,450,000 shares of New CET Common Stock to Classes 17(a), 17(b),
18(a) and 18(b) (subject to the reductions specified in Article IV.B.22.b.),
then (x) the total number of shares of New CET Common Stock issued to Classes
17(a), 17(b), 18(a), and 18(b) shall bear the proportional relationship to (y)
the shares of New CET Common Stock issued to Lenders of 49% to 51%, before
giving effect to the reductions in Article IV.B.22.b.(2) and (3) for the shares
of New CET Common Stock which would otherwise have been issued to Persons in
Class 18(a) or Classes 17(a) or 17(b) whose shares are redeemed for Cash.

24. TREATMENT OF CLASS 4 CLAIM: PRINCIPAL MUTUAL SECURED
CLAIM. The holder of the Class 4 Claim has obtained relief from the automatic
stay. The property which is security for said Claim shall be sold at
foreclosure sale pursuant to applicable state law and in consideration of the
full and final satisfaction of said Claim. The Principal Mutual Secured Claim
shall retain all legal, equitable and contractual rights to which it is
entitled; provided, that the holder of the Principal Mutual Secured Claim shall
not be entitled to any General Unsecured Claim against CET or Reorganized CET
and CET reserves all defenses, objections, counterclaims, and offsets with
respect to any such General Unsecured Claim.

25. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO SUN LIFE OF AMERICA. The
following provisions shall be applicable to the following Sun Life of America
classes: Classes 6(b) -- Regency Plaza, 6(c) -- Sierra Oaks, 6(d) -- Sunrise
Hills, and 6(e) -- University Village:

a. The holder of said Allowed Claim secured by a
Senior Mortgage shall retain its lien upon and security interest in all real
and personal property collateral granted to secure said Allowed Claim, which
lien and security interest shall have the same priority it had as of the
Petition Date. The Proponents acknowledge that the Sun Life of America deeds
of trust and security interests on all of its collateral are duly recorded and
perfected first priority deeds of trust and security interests against which no
defenses or offsets exist.

b. The Proponents shall seek from the Court a
finding of fact and an order that the value of the real property and personal
property liens and security interests securing said Allowed Claim equals at
least the amount of the Allowed Claim as set forth in Article IV.B. of the Plan
hereof and that the Allowed Claim in said class is fully secured under Code
sections 506(a) and 506(b).

c. The applicable Restructured Secured Note,
Restructured Deed of Trust or security instrument and the cash

57
<PAGE> 63

payment required to be made on the Effective Date shall be deemed to be in full
satisfaction of all Allowed Claims asserted by the holder thereof, including,
but not limited to, any Administrative Claim and any Priority Unsecured Claim
allowable under Code sections 503 or 507 arising in connection with this
Chapter 11 Case, including Claims on account of the Debtor's use of collateral
or cash collateral or continuation of the automatic stay.

d. All debt instruments and agreements under
which said Claim arises (including but not limited to recorded deeds of trust,
fixtures filings and rent assignments, and filed UCC financing statements)
shall remain in effect, except to the extent amended and superseded by the
applicable Restructured Secured Note and Restructured Deed of Trust, which
shall be issued by Reorganized CET in recordable form on the Effective Date in
a form which shall be filed with the Court prior to the Effective Date, under
which:

(1) the Allowed Claim as set forth in
Article IV.B. of the Plan shall constitute the principal indebtedness of the
Restructured Secured Note and Restructured Deed of Trust;

(2) there shall be no late fees provided
for in the Restructured Secured Note but default interest at the rate of two
percent (2%) per annum in excess of the contract rate under the applicable
Restructured Secured Note shall be due upon unpaid principal and accrued
interest until all defaults are cured;

(3) there shall be no financial
covenants or other covenants except the duty to (i) maintain the property, (ii)
pay insurance and (iii) provide a monthly tax payment to an impound account;

(4) the recordation of the Pacific

Senior Mortgagee, so long as CET pays the Senior Mortgagee an assumption fee of
one percent (1%) on the unpaid balance of the Senior Mortgagee's Restructured
Secured Note up to $1 million plus an additional three-eighths of one percent
(.375%) assumption fee on the remainder of the Senior Mortgagee's unpaid
principal note balance. Any other transfer, assignment or sale of the property
is an event of default that would allow the Senior Mortgagee to accelerate the
note;

(5) the Restructured Secured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust shall be without recourse to Reorganized CET as set
forth in the prepetition documents except

58
<PAGE> 64

that the imposition of a junior lien or the making of a conveyance permissible
under this Third Amended Plan as modified shall not cause recourse liability;

(6) the Restructured Secured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust shall not contain prepayment penalties or any other
provisions which would give rise to a default under the terms of the Plan or
terms which would be inconsistent with the treatment of the particular Allowed
Claim provided for under the Plan; and

(7) the Restructured Secured Note and
Restructured Deed of Trust shall provide that the filing of the Chapter 11 Case
is not a default under the Restructured Secured Note and the Restructured Deed
of Trust.

e. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article
IV.B.25(d) above, Reorganized CET shall deliver to Sun Life of America on the
Effective Date New Deeds of Trust and New Promissory Notes for Sierra Oaks,

promptly produce for copying and/or inspection to Sun Life of America all
leases and other documents reflecting modifications, terminations, extensions,

contract non-default rate of interest through June 1, 1994), plus (c) any other
adequate protection payments made on account of the Sunrise

59
<PAGE> 65

Hills property and received from June 1, 1994 to the Effective Date which
exceed the contract non-default interest.

g. On the Effective Date, CET's counsel shall
provide Sun Life of America with a legal opinion regarding the enforceability
of the loan documents provided to Sun Life of America pursuant to the Plan.

h. On the Effective Date, CET shall provide Sun
Life of America, at no cost to Sun Life of America, with the narrative
appraisals on the Regency Plaza, Sierra Oaks and Sunrise Hills properties
prepared by Coopers & Lybrand and certified to Sun Life of America in form and
substance previously filed with the Bankruptcy Court.

i. The liens granted Sun Life of America
pursuant to Articles IV.B.5, 6, 7 and 8, whether by Restructured Deeds of Trust
or, in the case of Sierra Oaks, Regency Plaza or Sunrise Hills or any of them,
by New Deeds of Trust, shall constitute a first priority lien on the property
applicable to each Restructured Deed of Trust or New Deed of Trust senior and
enforceable against each and every lien, encumbrance or interest of any kind
asserted in or against the property except for liens on each property, if any,
securing real property taxes applicable to each such property. Sun Life of
America and Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, as agent for several
lenders, shall execute any and all documents reasonably necessary to
subordinate the Pacific Mutual Lenders' liens in accordance with and to
effectuate the purpose of this paragraph.

j. The provisions of the Confirmation Order
determining that the Allowed Claims of Sun Life of America are fully secured
under 11 U.S.C. Section 506 shall not prejudice the right of Sun Life of
America to prove that a deficiency claim may exist at a later date, to the
extent Reorganized CET has recourse liability.

26. CLASS 14 CLAIMS: SECURED REAL PROPERTY TAX CLAIMS OF

such Claim (other than Allowed Claims) any Claims, setoffs or recoupments of
any nature whatsoever the Debtor or Reorganized CET may have against the

Lenders to the extent said Claims objections are not settled before
Confirmation.

C. CONTINUING COMMITTEES. Notwithstanding Confirmation of the
Plan, the Equity Holders' Committee and the Creditors' Committee and their
respective professionals shall continue to serve in the Chapter 11 Case for the
purpose of exercising the right to object to any Claim or Equity Interest other
than

72
<PAGE> 78

Allowed Claims or Allowed Equity Interests which are settled or fixed under the
Plan, and (with respect to the Equity Committee) for purposes of monitoring the
issuance of New CET Common Stock, redemption of Old CET Common Stock, and
filing a motion or being heard on a motion to extend the date for submission of
Old CET Common Stock under Article VI.M. of the Plan. Subject to Article VI.H.
of this Plan, each committee may employ and Reorganized CET may compensate
professionals for services rendered before and after the Effective Date.

D. RESOLUTION OF THE LUEBKEMAN LITIGATION. The Proponents intend
to resolve the issues raised in and by the Luebkeman Litigation either prior
to, or concurrently with, Confirmation of the Plan. If the Luebkeman
Litigation is so resolved, the Proponents will file an appropriate motion with
the Bankruptcy Court to approve the settlement outlining the terms of any such
settlement. If the Luebkeman Litigation is not resolved prior to Confirmation,
the Luebkeman Litigation will continue to be prosecuted post-Confirmation as an
Estate Action. Reorganized CET shall be appointed as the representative of the
Estate to pursue the Luebkeman Litigation.

E. INDEMNIFICATION. CET and Reorganized CET shall indemnify
their present and former officers and trustees, pursuant to the applicable
state law or any agreement, board minutes, declaration of trust or bylaws that
were in effect at any time prior to Confirmation, in connection with any events
occurring before, on or after the Filing Date or the Confirmation, but neither
CET nor Reorganized CET shall have any indemnification obligations to (i) Sonia
Allen, Jeffrey Berger, or any insiders or affiliates of Sonia Allen or Jeffrey
Berger (except this clause (i) does not abrogate indemnification obligations to
the present officers and trustees of CET) or (ii) any present or former agent
or attorney for CET (except in such agent's or attorney's capacity as a present
or former officer or trustee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
settlement agreement with Jeffrey Berger or Sonia Allen, or any settlement
agreement regarding the Luebkeman Litigation, which settlement agreement is
approved by the Bankruptcy Court, makes different provisions for
indemnification of Jeffrey Berger or Sonia Allen to the extent insurance is
available, then such Court- approved settlement agreement shall govern and
supersede to the extent this Article VIII.E. of the Plan is inconsistent with
said settlement agreement.

F. WAIVER OF ADEQUATE PROTECTION CLAIMS:
------------------------------------

1. The Lenders waive and release all Allowed Priority
Claims and Administration Claims arising from use of collateral, use of cash
collateral, failure of adequate protection, or otherwise.

73
<PAGE> 79

2. Debtor and Reorganized CET each waive and release all
claims arising under Bankruptcy Code section 506(c) against Lenders, holders of
Senior Mortgages, and all real and personal property vested in Reorganized CET
pursuant to this Plan, for amounts paid or incurred by Debtor before the
Effective Date which benefitted assets vested in Reorganized CET.

3. Lenders have agreed that any Administrative Claim or
application for payment of Lenders' professional fees and expenses under Code
section 503(b) shall be limited to those fees and expenses incurred on or after
April 18, 1994.

G. RELEASE OF LENDERS LITIGATION:
-----------------------------

1. The Lenders Allowed Claim shall be allowed in full as
provided in this Plan and shall not be subject to any set off or subordination
under section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law. Except as
expressly provided in this Plan, all controversies, claims (including, without
limitation, any Miscellaneous Claims), objections, and defenses that were or
could have been asserted in the Chapter 11 Case or in any action, case or
proceeding with respect to the Lenders' Claim, the Lender Loans, or the
Lenders' actions or inactions at any time are fully and finally compromised,
released and extinguished. The Debtor, Reorganized CET, all creditors, holders
of claims against the Debtor or the Estate, equity security holders, and
parties in interest, and their privities, are barred and enjoined from
litigating such claims (including, without limitation, any Miscellaneous
Claims), controversies, objections and defenses.

2. The Lenders Litigation shall be dismissed with
prejudice. The Debtor, Reorganized CET, all holders of Claims against the
Debtor or Estate, all holders of any Equity Interests in or against the Debtor
or the Estate, parties in interest, any other Person and their privities, are
barred and enjoined from litigating such Claims, controversies, objections and
defenses. At the hearing on Confirmation, the Proponents shall request that
the Bankruptcy Court determine that the settlement of the Lenders Litigation is
made in good faith within the meaning of California Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6.

3. The definitive documents for such compromise shall be
filed with the Bankruptcy Court prior to the Confirmation Date and this Plan
may be modified by the Proponents at any time prior to the Effective Date in
order to make this Article of the Plan consistent with said definitive
documents.

4. The Distributions under the Plan, the determination
of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity Interests under Article IV. of this Plan,
and the settlements and waivers of Claims and priorities set forth in this Plan
take into account the relative priority of the Claims in each class in
connection

74
<PAGE> 80

with any subordination provisions arising under law or contract, as well as any
grounds for disallowance of, or defenses, setoffs, recoupments or counterclaims
against any Allowed Claims, Allowed Equity Interests, Disputed Claims, or
Disputed Interests that are the subject of Article IV. or the compromises and
settlements in this Article VIII.G. Accordingly, the Distributions to the
holders of Allowed Claims in Class 2 shall not be subject to any complaint,
levy, garnishment, attachment or other legal process by reason of any alleged
subordination (under Bankruptcy Code section 510(c) or otherwise), defense,
setoff, recoupment or counterclaim. The Confirmation Order shall permanently
enjoin, effective as of the Effective Date, the Debtor, Reorganized CET, all
holders of Claims against or interests in the Debtor, and all parties in the
Chapter 11 Case and all of their respective privities from enforcing or
attempting to enforce any such rights with respect to the Distributions under
the Plan to the holders of Allowed Claims in Class 2.

5. Reorganized CET shall indemnify and hold each Lender
harmless from any Claims asserted against, or liabilities incurred by, Lenders
(including all professional fees and costs), in any action, claim or proceeding
commenced or continued by or prosecuted on behalf of (i) any present or former
officers, agents, or trustees of the Debtor, (ii) any holders of interest in or
Claims against the Debtor, (iii) any present or former officers, agents, or
trustees of CalREIT, (iv) any holders of interest in or claims against CalREIT,
or (v) any privities of the persons described in clauses (i) through (iv)
above, which action, Claim, or proceeding has been or could have been raised in
the Chapter 11 Case or the Lenders Litigation, or has been released, settled,
or determined under or pursuant to this Plan.

H. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION. Notwithstanding Confirmation or
the Effective Date having occurred, the Bankruptcy Court shall retain full
jurisdiction as provided in 28 U.S.C. section 1334 to enforce the provisions,
purposes, and intent of this Plan, including without limitation:

1. Prosecution of any and all Estate Actions;

2. Determination of all causes of action, controversies,
disputes or conflicts between CET and any other party which are not settled,
released, or waived under the Plan and which existed prior to the Effective
Date, whether or not pending theretofore;

3. Determination of the allowance of Claims and Equity
Interests upon objection to such Claims and Equity Interests, and estimation of
any Claim or Equity Interest;

Stock.

8. Implementation of the provisions of this Plan and
entry of orders in aid of Confirmation, including without limitation

Reorganized CET from creditor action, and orders for persons to perform acts
necessary for consummation of this Plan under Bankruptcy Code section 1142;

9. Adjudication of any causes of action commenced or 
continued by the Debtor or by Reorganized CET.

<PAGE> 82

I. ORDERS TO AID CONSUMMATION OF PLAN. This Plan constitutes and
incorporates a motion under Code section 1142 and Rules 7069 and 7070 for an
order to cause Debtor and all its present and former trustees, officers,
agents, employees, attorneys, accountants, and stock transfer agents to
cooperate fully in providing Proponents and Reorganized CET (and its board of
trustees, management, and agents) with all information and access to properties
and assets of the Estate; to execute conveyances and authorizations reasonably
necessary to vest title to the Estate assets in Reorganized CET and its board
of trustees; and to execute and deliver such documents and perform such acts as
are reasonably necessary to enable Reorganized CET and its board of trustees
and management to take possession, custody, and control of all assets vested in
Reorganized CET pursuant to this Plan. None of the Debtor, its present or
former professionals, or its present or former trustees, employees, or agents
shall perform or fail to perform any act that would impair the value of
Reorganized CET or interfere with the control by Reorganized CET over property
of the estate.

J. MODIFICATION OF PLAN; REVOCATION AND WITHDRAWAL:

1. The Proponents may, with the consent of all
Proponents, alter, amend or modify the Plan under section 1127 of the Code and
Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure Rules 2002 and 3017 at any time prior to
Confirmation. Any Proponent also may institute proceedings in the Bankruptcy
Court to remedy any defect or omission or reconcile any inconsistencies in the
Plan, Disclosure Statement or the Confirmation Order, and such matters as may
be necessary to carry out the purposes and effects of the Plan; provided,
however, that prior notice of such proceedings is served on all parties
affected by the same in accordance with Bankruptcy Rules 2002 and 9014.

2. Any Proponent reserves the right to cease being a
co-proponent of the Plan. The Plan may be revoked or withdrawn prior to
Confirmation either by the consent of all Proponents or by CET.

3. If all Proponents revoke or withdraw the Plan prior
to Confirmation or if Confirmation or the Effective Date do not occur, then the
Plan shall be deemed null and void. In such event, nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to constitute an admission against interest or a waiver or
release of any claims by or against any of CET, the Proponents, any claimant,
any interest holder or any other person or prejudice in any manner the rights
of CET or any person in any further proceedings involving CET.

K. STANDING OF PRE-EFFECTIVE DATE CET BOARD OF TRUSTEES After the
Effective Date, the pre-Effective Date CET Board of Trustees shall have
standing and the right to appear and be heard

77
<PAGE> 83

before the Bankruptcy Court or any other court, in their capacity as the
pre-Effective Date CET Board of Trustees, but not as representatives of the
Estate or of Reorganized CET, regarding any issues or disputes which relate to
events which occurred prior to the Effective Date. Reorganized CET shall
reimburse the pre-Effective Date CET Board of Trustees for reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses incurred by them, but only in connection with any such
matters which relate to (1) objections to Administrative Claims or (2) appeals
from the Confirmation Order, subject to application and approval by the
Bankruptcy Court, and subject to an aggregate limit of $25,000 in fees and
expenses.

L. DISCHARGE OF TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS. On the Effective Date,
CET's trustees and officers are discharged from any further duties as
representatives of CET as debtor in possession under the Code.

M. DISCHARGE OF CET AND INJUNCTION:
-------------------------------

1. DISCHARGE. The rights afforded under the Plan and
the treatment of all Allowed Claims and the Allowed Equity Interests as
provided shall be in exchange for and in complete satisfaction, discharge, and
release of all Claims and Equity Interests of any nature whatsoever, including
any interest accrued on such Claims from and after the Petition Date or
interest which would have accrued but for the commencement of this case,
against CET, or any of its assets or properties. Except as otherwise provided
in this Plan: (a) on the Effective Date, CET shall be deemed discharged to the
fullest extent permitted by section 1141 of the Code from all debts and
interests, including, but not limited to, debts and interests and Old CET
Securities (including any asserted warrants or stock options) that arose before
the Confirmation Date and all debts of a kind specified in sections 502(g),
502(h), or 502(i) of the Code whether or not: (i) a proof of Claim or proof of
Equity Interest is filed or deemed filed pursuant to section 501 of the Code;
(ii) a debt or interest based on such debt or interest is allowed pursuant to
section 502 of the Code, or (iii) the holder of a debt or interest based on

CET, Reorganized CET, the Committees or their professionals, successors,
assigns, members, assets or properties any other or further debts or interests
based upon any act or omission, transaction, or other activity of any kind or
nature that occurred prior to the Confirmation Date, all of which debts and
interests shall be conclusively deemed released and discharged. The
Confirmation Order shall act as a discharge of any and all debts and
liabilities of CET, as provided in sections 524 and 1141 of the Code, and such
discharge shall void any judgment against CET or Reorganized CET at any time
obtained to the extent that it relates to a Claim discharged.

78
<PAGE> 84

2. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Confirmation of this Plan shall, as of the Effective Date, constitute a
discharge, under Bankruptcy Code section 1141(d) of all claims and causes of
action that arose before Confirmation against the Debtor or Reorganized CET
which have been or could have been asserted by any creditors or equity security
holders of CalREIT.

3. All Claims, defenses, offsets, rights of recoupment,
rights to dividends, voting rights, and all powers and authority of Debtor
against CalREIT are retained and vested in Reorganized CET. Except as set
forth in Article VIII.M.2. above, all Claims, defenses, offsets, rights of
recoupment, powers and authority of CalREIT against Debtor are retained and may
be asserted against Reorganized CET.

N. INJUNCTION. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or the
Confirmation Order, on and after the Effective Date, all Persons and entities
who have held, currently hold or may hold a Claim or Equity Interest discharged
pursuant to the terms of the Plan are permanently enjoined from taking any of
the following actions on account of any such discharged Claim or Equity
Interest: (i) commencing or continuing, in any manner and in any place, any
action or proceeding against CET, Reorganized CET, the Equity Holders'
Committee, the Creditors' Committee, and their respective successors, assigns,
agents, assets, or property; (ii) enforcing, attaching, collecting or
recovering in any manner any judgment, award, decree or order against CET,
Reorganized CET, the Committees and their respective successors, assigns,
agents, assets, or property; (iii) creating, perfecting or enforcing any lien
against CET, Reorganized CET, the Committees and their respective successors,
assigns, agents, assets, or property; (iv) asserting any setoff, right of
subrogation or recoupment of any kind against any obligation due to CET,
Reorganized CET, the Committee or their respective successors, assigns, agents,
assets, or property; and (v) commencing or continuing any action or
proceeding, in any manner and in any place, that does not comply with or is
inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. Any entity injured by any
willful violation of such injunction shall recover actual damages, including
costs and professional fees and, in appropriate circumstances, punitive damages
from the willful violator.

O. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Committees, the Debtor, CET,
Reorganized CET, the Lenders, and their respective present and former members,
officers, directors, trustees, employees, agents, designees, successors or
assigns, or any professional person employed by any of them, shall neither have
nor incur any liability to any entity for any action taken or omission made in
good faith in connection with or related to formulating, confirming or
consummating or implementing the Plan, the

79

2. The conditions specified in this Article VIII.P. may

Q. SEVERABILITY. If the Bankruptcy Court determines, prior to
the Confirmation Date, that any provision of the Plan is illegal either as
written or as applied to any Claim or Equity Interest, as the case may be, such
provision shall be either unenforceable generally or as applied to such Claim
or Equity Interest. A determination that a provision of this Plan is illegal
or not enforceable as to a particular Claim or Equity Interest shall in no way
limit or affect the enforceability and operative effect of any other provision
of the Plan or of that provision as applied to other Claims or Equity Interests
and the Proponents may modify the Plan to withdraw such provision.

R. HEADINGS OF ARTICLES AND SECTIONS. The headings of the
Articles and Sections of the Plan are inserted for convenience only and shall
in no way affect the interpretation of its provisions.

S. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The rights, benefits and obligations
of any entity referred to in the Plan shall be binding on, and shall inure to
the benefit of, the heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns of
such entity.

and conditions set forth herein as such parties in their mutual agreement from
time to time may see fit, without notice except as otherwise required by the
Bankruptcy Court or applicable law. Additional terms (including covenants and
events of default) may be included in the definitive agreements for the
Lenders' Senior Secured Loan Documents. Any and all documents attached to or
filed with a modification of Plan filed with the Bankruptcy Court shall
supersede the provisions of this summary and shall be controlling where
inconsistent with this summary. All capitalized terms have the meanings
defined in the First Amended Plan.

Amount: $40 million in the aggregate

SUMMARY OF TERMS OF NEW CET PREFERRED STOCK
-------------------------------------------

The following is a summary of the terms of the Preferred Stock to be
issued to the Lenders pursuant to a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. CET,
the Lenders and the Equity Holders' Committee reserve the right to propose or
agree to additional, deletions or other changes in the terms and conditions set
forth herein as such parties in their mutual agreement from time to time may
see fit, without notice except as otherwise required by the Bankruptcy Court or
applicable law. Additional terms may be included in the charter documents and
other documents relating to the Preferred Stock. Any and all documents
attached to a modification of Plan filed with the Court shall supersede the
provisions of this summary and shall be controlling where inconsistent with
this summary.

Issuer: Reorganized CET

Securities: The Lenders will receive a total of _____
shares of Reorganized CET's Preferred Stock,
having a par value of [$.01] per share and a
stated value (the "Stated Value") of Two
Dollars ($2.00) per share (the "Preferred
Stock")

Priority: The Preferred Stock will have priority over
all other equity securities of Reorganized
CET with respect to dividend rights and
rights of redemption and upon voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up.

Dividend: The Preferred Stock will earn dividends on a
cumulative basis from the date of issuance
whether or not earned or declared at a rate
of ten percent (10%) per annum of the Stated
Value; provided, however, that until October
1, 1998, dividends may be paid in additional
shares of Preferred Stock rather than cash.
Dividends will be payable quarterly on each
March 31, June 30, September 30 and December
31. No dividends will be paid or declared on
the Common Stock until (i) all accrued and
unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock have
been paid in full and (ii) interest on the
Lender's Note has been paid current in cash.

Liquidation Upon any voluntary or involuntary
Preference: dissolution or winding up of the affairs of 
Reorganized CET, the holders of Preferred 
Stock will be first paid out of the assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to
its shareholders an amount in cash equal to

90
<PAGE> 96
the Stated Value plus all accrued and unpaid
dividends before any payment may be made or
any assets distributed to the holders of any
junior equity securities. Holders of
Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any
other distributions in the event of such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of Reorganized CET.

Voting Rights: Holders of Preferred Stock will have the 
right to elect one member of the Board and to
vote upon certain major events (described 
below) or as provided by law, but will have 
no other voting rights. So long as any 
shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, 
the Articles of Incorporation or Declaration 
of Trust, as the case may be, will provide 
that Reorganized CET may not, without the
approval of fifty-one percent (51%) of the 
issued and outstanding shares of Preferred 
Stock voting together prior to the Preferred 
Stock, either as to dividends or redemption 
or upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, (b) increase
additional shares of Preferred Stock, except 
to pay dividends on the Preferred Stock, (c) 
amend, alter, waive the application of or 
repeal (whether by merger, consolidation or 
otherwise) any provision of the Articles of 
Incorporation or the Declaration of Trust, as
the case may be, of Reorganized CET, or
enter into any agreement or take any other 
action which would alter, change or otherwise
adversely affect the powers, rights or 
preferences of the Preferred Stock, (d) 
effect the liquidation, sale, lease, 
conveyance or exchange of all or 
substantially all of the assets, property or 
business of Reorganized CET, or the merger 
or consolidation of Reorganized CET with or 
into any other corporation (other than 
California Real Estate Investment Trust)
or the occurrence of a Change-In- Control 
Transaction (as hereinafter defined), (e) 
take any action which would cause a dividend 
or other distribution to be deemed to be 
received by the holders of the Preferred
Stock for federal income tax purposes unless 
it is actually received by such holders, or 
(f) at

91
<PAGE> 97
any time after October 1, 1998, when
Reorganized CET has not paid, when due, cash
dividends on the Preferred Stock for three
consecutive quarters, incur any indebtedness
other than purchase money indebtedness.

"Change-In-Control Transaction" means any
transaction or series of related transactions
resulting in any person or persons acting in
concert who were not theretofore the holder
or holders of voting securities enabling the
holder or holders thereof to cast more than a
majority of the votes which may be cast for
the election of directors becoming the holder
or holders of at least such amount of voting
securities (for such purpose, treating
instruments or securities issued in such
transaction which are convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for voting
securities as being so converted, exchanged
or exercised upon issuance, regardless of the
terms thereof), provided, however, that a
change-in-control which results from the
transfer or transfers of such voting
securities by the holders of the Preferred
Stock shall not be deemed a Change-In-Control
Transaction, as defined herein.

Election So long as any Preferred Stock is
of Board: the Board will consist of up to
five members, and the holders of fifty-one 
percent (51%) of the shares of then-
outstanding Preferred Stock will be entitled 
to elect one director. The other directors 
will be elected by the holders of Common 
Stock of Reorganized CET.

Conversion: Optional Conversion

Upon the issuance in a single offering or
transaction (the "New Issuance") by
Reorganized CET of Common Stock and/or any
equity securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock
for an aggregate purchase price equal to or
greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%)
of the sum of (i) the aggregate Stated Value
of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
plus (ii) all accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon, Reorganized CET will have the right
to cause the conversion of all outstanding
Preferred Stock into Common Stock at a
conversion price equal to 80% of the New
Issuance offering price.

92
<PAGE> 98
Mandatory Conversion

All outstanding Preferred Stock will
automatically convert into Common Stock at a
price per share equal to the Stated Value
upon (i) any failure on and after October 1,
1998, by the Corporation to declare and pay
any cash dividend on the Preferred Stock for
90 days after the payment date, or (ii) the
failure by Reorganized CET to redeem the
Preferred Stock (and to pay all accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon) within ten (10)
days after the occurrence of any event
requiring it to do so.

Redemption: Upon (i) either (a) the consummation by
Reorganized CET of a Major Event for which
consent of the holders of Preferred Stock has
been sought but not obtained, or (b) the
consummation by Reorganized CET of a Major
Event without the requisite consent of the
Holders of Preferred Stock having been
sought, or (ii) the maturity date, October 1,
2000, Reorganized CET must redeem all
outstanding Preferred Stock not more than ten
(10) days following such event for cash at a
redemption price per share equal to the
Stated Value plus all accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon provided, however, that the
redemption rights under subsections (i)(a)
and (i)(b), hereof, may be waived by election
of the holders of fifty one percent (51%) of
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.
If Reorganized CET fails to redeem the
Preferred Stock within such ten-day period,
all such shares will be converted to Common
Stock.

Registration Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement,
Rights: and subject to certain minimum share and
offering amount requirements set forth 
therein, (i) the holders of CET Common Stock 
issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock and 
(ii) the holders of New CET Common Stock 
issued to the Lenders pursuant to the Plan 
will be entitled to two demand registrations, 
unlimited short form registrations and 
unlimited piggyback rights, at the expense of 
Reorganized CET.

Anti-dilution Anti-dilution protection will be provided only
Rights: in the event of the issuance or issuances of 
Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents at 
less than Two Dollars ($2.00) per share,
any reclassification or change of the Common 
Stock, any consolidation or merger of

93
<PAGE> 99
Reorganized CET (other than a merger with
California Real Estate Investment Trust), any
subdivision or combination of shares of
Common Stock or certain payments of dividends
or distribution in Common Stock. Adjustments
for issuances of Common Stock or Common Stock
equivalents at less than Two Dollars ($2.00)
per share will be on a weighted average
basis.
