THERMO INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES INTENT TO
ACQUIRE SEVERAL ENVIROTECH BUSINESSES OF BAKER HUGHES

WALTHAM, Mass., January 31, 1994 -- Thermo Instrument Systems Inc. (ASE-THI)
announced today its intention to acquire several of the businesses that
constitute the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls group of Baker Hughes
Incorporated for a cash purchase price of approximately $93 million. The company
intends to acquire the EnviroTech Controls, Noran Instruments, TN Technologies,
and Tremetrics businesses, which collectively design, manufacture, and market a
variety of process control, process measurement, and laboratory analytical
products for use in a wide range of industrial, energy, environmental, and
research applications. 

Thermo Electron Corporation, the parent company of Thermo Instrument Systems,
has entered into an acquisition agreement with Baker Hughes with respect to this
transaction and a related transaction in which another Thermo Electron
subsidiary, Thermedics Inc., will acquire Ramsey Technologies and Epsilon
Industrial, also part of the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls group. Thermo
Electron will assign its rights to acquire the respective businesses to Thermo
Instrument Systems and Thermedics. Consummation of the acquisitions is subject
to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.

The businesses to be acquired by Thermo Instrument Systems had combined sales
of approximately $129 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 1993.

"We are excited about the opportunities these new businesses represent in
terms of complementary technologies and additional markets," said Arvin H.
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Instrument Systems.
"We're gaining two more fundamental analytical technologies - gas chromatography
and X-ray fluorescence - that address key portions of worldwide markets. We also
are gaining a greater presence in on-line process instrumentation, another
market in which we believe we can build a strong competitive position."

Thermo Instrument Systems develops, manufactures, and markets analytical
instruments used to detect and monitor air pollution, radioactivity, complex
chemical compounds, and toxic metals and other elements in a broad range of
liquids and solids. The company also provides environmental science and
engineering services, laboratory-based testing, and nuclear health physics
services. Thermo Instrument Systems is a public subsidiary of Thermo Electron
Corporation.
