Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
---------------------------------------------

(a) Previous independent accountants

(i) On March 1, 1994, Registrant's Board of Directors decided 
to appoint Price Waterhouse as Registrant's independent
accountants for fiscal year 1994, subject to ratification
by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders
to be held May 5, 1994. Price Waterhouse replaces Coopers &
Lybrand who have been Registrant's independent accountants
since Registrant's inception in 1987. The change was made
to realize certain synergies between Registrant and its new
40% stockholder Cyprus Amax Minerals Company following the
merger of AMAX Inc. with and into Cyprus Minerals Company
on November 15, 1993. Price Waterhouse are the independent
accountants for Cyprus Amax.

(ii) The reports of Coopers & Lybrand on the financial 
statements for the past two fiscal years contained no
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles.

(iii) The Registrant's Audit Committee participated in and 
approved the decision to change independent accountants.

(iv) In connection with its audits for the two most recent 
fiscal years and through March 1, 1994, there have been no
disagreements with Coopers & Lybrand on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of
Coopers & Lybrand would have caused them to make reference
thereto in their report on the financial statements for such
years.

(v) During the two most recent fiscal years and through March 
1, 1994, there have been no reportable events (as defined
in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(l)(v)).

(vi) The Registrant has requested that Coopers & Lybrand furnish
it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or
not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of such
letter, dated March 7, 1994 is filed as Exhibit 1 to this
Form 8-K.

(b) New independent accountants

(i) The Registrant engaged Price Waterhouse as its new 
independent accountants as of March 1, 1994. During the two
most recent fiscal years and through March 1, 1994, the
Registrant has not consulted with Price Waterhouse on

items which (1) were or should have been subject to
Statement of Auditing Standards No. 50 or (2) concerned the
subject matter of a disagreement or reportable event with
the former auditor, (as described in Regulation S-K
