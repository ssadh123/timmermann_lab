provided, however, that at the time of the Trust's investment or
contractual commitment to invest therein, the short-term deposits or
commercial paper (other than such obligation whose rating is based on
the credit of a person or entity other than such institution or trust
company) of such depository institution or trust company (or in the case of a
depository institution which is the principal subsidiary in a
holding company system, of the holding company in such system) have a
credit rating not lower than the highest rating category from the Rating Agency,
or such certificates of deposit are fully insured by the FDIC;

Section 2.02. Amended Definition of "Permitted Investments." The
