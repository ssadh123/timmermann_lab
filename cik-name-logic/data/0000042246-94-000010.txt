Item 5. Other Events.

On May 25, 1994, the Registrant obtained a $525 million
five-year reducing revolving credit facility (the
"Facility") from a group of 18 commercial banks led by
Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association. 
The Facility replaces the Registrant's prior $150 million
bank credit facility. Borrowings under the Facility are
tied, at the Registrant's option, to the prime rate or
the one-, two-, three- or six-month London Interbank
Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). The interest rate for borrowings
tied to the one-month LIBOR is currently approximately 6%
per annum. Borrowings under the Facility are available
for working capital and general corporate purposes,
including the development of new gaming projects and the
retirement of outstanding indebtedness.

Borrowings under the Facility are collateralized by a
first lien on most of the Registrant's and its
subsidiaries' (other than non-Restricted Subsidiaries, as
defined) previously unencumbered assets, including
Shadow Creek Golf Course and the Dunes site. At such
time as the first mortgage notes collateralized by The
Mirage and the Treasure Island hotel-casinos are no longer
outstanding, the Facility will also be collateralized by
a first lien on those properties. The Registrant's non-
Restricted Subsidiaries include those which own and
operate the Golden Nugget and Golden-Nugget Laughlin
hotel-casinos, and borrowings under the Facility are
not collateralized by those properties.

The Reducing Revolving Loan Agreement (the "Loan
Agreement") governing the Facility contains a number of
covenants applicable to the Registrant and its
subsidiaries (other than non-Restricted Subsidiaries),
including those relating to the maintenance of specified
tangible net worth, interest charge coverage and 
leverage ratios and certain limitations on further
indebtedness, liens, capital expenditures, investments 
and dividends and stock repurchases. A copy of the Loan 
Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.

outstanding under the Notes, plus (ii) the Aggregate Effective
Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, plus (iii) the Swing

shall be made pursuant to a Request for Loan which shall specify
the requested (i) date of such Loan, (ii) type of Loan,
(iii) amount of such Loan, and (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar

telephone by a Responsible Official of Borrowers, in which case 
Borrowers shall confirm such request by promptly delivering a 
Request for Loan in person or by telecopier conforming to the
preceding sentence to the Administrative Co-Agent. Administrative
Co-Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever hereunder in acting

if made and giving effect to the application of the proceeds
thereof, would not increase the outstanding principal Indebtedness
evidenced by the Committed Advance Notes, then Borrowers shall be 
deemed to have requested, as of the date upon which the related 
then outstanding Loan is due pursuant to Section 3.1(f)(i), an
Alternate Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to the amount
necessary to cause the outstanding principal Indebtedness
evidenced by the Notes to remain the same and, subject to Section 
8.3, the Banks shall make the Advances necessary to make such 
Loan notwithstanding Sections 2.1(b), 2.2 and 2.3.

Administrative Co-Agent in person or by telecopier of a written
Competitive Bid Request. The Administrative Co-Agent shall incur
no liability whatsoever hereunder in acting upon any telephonic
Competitive Bid Request purportedly made by a Responsible Official

which offers an interest rate other than a fixed interest rate or

must accept all Absolute Rate Bids at all lower fixed interest
rates before accepting any portion of an Absolute Rate Bid at a
higher fixed interest rate, (b) Borrowers must accept all
Eurodollar Margin Bids at all lower margins over the Eurodollar

at a higher margin over the Eurodollar Base Rate, (c) if two or

interest rate or margin, then Borrowers must accept either all of
such Competitive Bids or accept such Competitive Bids in the same
proportion as the Maximum Competitive Advance of each Bank bears 
to the aggregate Maximum Competitive Advances of all such Banks,
and (d) Borrowers may not accept Competitive Bids for an aggregate 
amount in excess of the requested Competitive Advance set forth in 
the Competitive Bid Request. Acceptance by Borrowers of a

Borrowers by 8:30 a.m., in the case of a Eurodollar Margin Bid, on
the date which is three (3) Banking Days prior to the proposed
Competitive Advance or, in the case of an Absolute Rate Bid, on
the date of the proposed Competitive Bid, shall be deemed rejected.

Borrowers shall make the Competitive Advance in accordance with
the Competitive Bid Request and with its Competitive Bid, subject

sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount outstanding
under the Notes, plus (B) the Aggregate Effective Amount

Swing Line Outstandings plus (D) the Commercial Paper
Outstandings do not exceed the then applicable Commitment

the Banks otherwise consent in a writing delivered to the
Administrative Co-Agent, the term of any Letter of Credit
shall not exceed one (1) year or extend beyond the
Maturity Date. A Request for Letter of Credit shall be
irrevocable absent the consent of the Issuing Bank.

-47-

<PAGE>

(b) Each Request for Letter of Credit shall be
submitted to the Issuing Bank, with a copy to the
Administrative Co-Agent, at least five (5) Banking Days
prior to the date upon which the related Letter of Credit
is proposed to be issued. The Administrative Co-Agent
shall promptly notify the Issuing Bank whether such
Request for Letter of Credit, and the issuance of a
Letter of Credit pursuant thereto, conforms to the
requirements of this Agreement. Upon issuance of a
Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify
the Administrative Co-Agent, and the Administrative Co-
Agent shall promptly notify the Banks, of the amount and
terms thereof.

(c) Upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, each
Bank shall be deemed to have purchased a pro rata par-
ticipation in such Letter of Credit from the Issuing Bank
in an amount equal to that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the
Commitment. Without limiting the scope and nature of
each Bank's participation in any Letter of Credit, to the
extent that the Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed by
Borrowers for any payment required to be made by the
Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall,
pro rata according to its Pro Rata Share of the
Commitment, reimburse the Issuing Bank through the
Administrative Co-Agent promptly upon demand for the
amount of such payment. The obligation of each Bank to
so reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be absolute and uncon-
ditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of
an Event of Default or any other occurrence or event.
Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise
impair the obligation of Borrowers to reimburse the
Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by the
Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit together with
interest as hereinafter provided.

(d) Borrowers agree to pay to the Issuing Bank
through the Administrative Co-Agent an amount equal to
any payment made by the Issuing Bank with respect to each
Letter of Credit within one (1) Banking Day after demand
made by the Issuing Bank therefor, together with interest
on such amount from the date of any payment made by the
Issuing Bank at the Default Rate. The principal amount
of any such payment shall be used to reimburse the
Issuing Bank for the payment made by it under the Letter
of Credit. Each Bank that has reimbursed the Issuing
Bank pursuant to Section 2.5(c) for its Pro Rata Share of
any payment made by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit shall thereupon acquire a pro rata participation,
to the extent of such reimbursement, in the claim of the
Issuing Bank against Borrowers under this Section 2.5(d)
and shall share, in accordance with that pro-rata
participation, in any payment made by Borrowers with
respect to such claim.

(e) If Borrowers fail to make the payment
required by Section 2.5(d) within the time period therein
set forth, in lieu of the reimbursement to the Issuing
Bank under Section 2.5(c) the Issuing Bank may (but is
not required to), without notice to or the consent of
Borrowers, instruct the Administrative Co-Agent to cause
Advances to be made by the Banks under the Commitment in
an aggregate amount equal to the amount paid by the
Issuing Bank with respect to that Letter of Credit and,
for this purpose, the conditions precedent set forth in
Article 8 shall not apply. The proceeds of such Advances
shall be paid to the Issuing Bank to reimburse it for the
payment made by it under the Letter of Credit. Such
Advances shall be payable upon demand and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate.

(f) The issuance of any supplement, modification,
amendment, renewal, or extension to or of any Letter of
Credit shall be treated in all respects the same as the
issuance of a new Letter of Credit.

(g) The obligation of Borrowers to pay to the
Issuing Bank the amount of any payment made by the
Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit shall be abso-
lute, unconditional, and irrevocable, subject only to
performance by the Issuing Bank of its obligations to
Borrowers under Nevada Revised Statutes Section 104.5109.
Without limiting the foregoing, Borrowers' obligations
shall not be affected by any of the following
circumstances:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability 
of the Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or 
any other agreement or instrument relating 
thereto;

(ii) any amendment or waiver of or any
consent to departure from the Letter of Credit,
this Agreement, or any other agreement or
instrument relating thereto, with the consent of
Borrowers;

(iii) the existence of any claim, setoff,
defense, or other rights which Borrowers may
have at any time against the Issuing Bank, the 
Administrative Co-Agent or any Bank, any
beneficiary of the Letter of Credit (or any
persons or entities for whom any such beneficiary 
may be acting) or any other Person, whether in
connection with the Letter of Credit, this
Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument
relating thereto, or any unrelated transactions;

-49-

<PAGE>

(iv) any demand, statement, or any other
document presented under the Letter of Credit 
proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid, or
insufficient in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect
whatsoever so long as any such document appeared
to comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit;

(v) payment by the Issuing Bank in good
faith under the Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or any accompanying 
document which does not strictly comply with the
terms of the Letter of Credit;

(vi) the existence, character, quality,
quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery 
of any Property purported to be represented by
documents presented in connection with any Letter
of Credit or for any difference between any
such Property and the character, quality,
quantity, condition, or value of such Property as 
described in such documents;

(vii) the time, place, manner, order or
contents of shipments or deliveries of Property
as described in documents presented in connection
with any Letter of Credit or the existence,
nature and extent of any insurance relative
thereto;

(viii) the solvency or financial
responsibility of any party issuing any documents
in connection with a Letter of Credit;

(ix) any failure or delay in notice of
shipments or arrival of any Property;

(x) any error in the transmission of any 
message relating to a Letter of Credit not caused 
by the Issuing Bank, or any delay or interruption in 
any such message;

(xi) any error, neglect or default of any
correspondent of the Issuing Bank in connection with
a Letter of Credit;

(xii) any consequence arising from acts
of God, war, insurrection, civil unrest,
disturbances, labor disputes, emergency conditions
or other causes beyond the control of the Issuing
Bank;

-50-

<PAGE>

(xiii) so long as the Issuing Bank in
good faith determines that the contract or document 
appears to comply with the terms of the Letter of
Credit, the form, accuracy, genuineness or legal
effect of any contract or document referred to in any
document submitted to the Issuing Bank in connection
with a Letter of Credit; and

(xiv) where the Issuing Bank has acted in 
good faith and observed general banking usage, any
other circumstances whatsoever.

(h) The Issuing Bank shall be entitled to the pro-
tection accorded to the Administrative Co-Agent pursuant
to Section 10.6, mutatis mutandis.

(i) The Uniform Code of Practice for Documentary
Credits, as published in its most current version by the
International Chamber of Commerce, shall be deemed a part
of this Section and shall apply to all Letters of Credit
to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Law.

2.6 Voluntary Reduction of Commitment. Borrowers shall
have the right, at any time and from time to time, without
penalty or charge, upon at least three (3) Banking Days' prior
written notice by a Responsible Official of Borrowers to the
Administrative Co-Agent, voluntarily to reduce, permanently and
irrevocably, in aggregate principal amounts in an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 but not less than $5,000,000, or to
terminate, all or a portion of the then undisbursed portion of
the Commitment, provided that any such reduction or termination
shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued and unpaid
commitment fees with respect to the portion of the Commitment
being reduced or terminated. The Administrative Co-Agent shall
promptly notify the Banks of any reduction or termination of
the Commitment under this Section.

2.7 Contingent Reduction of Commitment. If, on any
Stage I Reduction Date, the Stage I Reduction Test is not
satisfied, the Commitment shall automatically be reduced on
that Stage I Reduction Date by the applicable Stage I Reduction
Amount. If, on any Stage II Reduction Date, the Stage II
Reduction Test is not satisfied, the Commitment shall
automatically be reduced on that Stage II Reduction Date by the
applicable Stage II Reduction Amount. A reduction in the
Commitment under this Section shall not be reversible upon any
subsequent satisfaction of the Stage I Reduction Test or
Stage II Reduction Test, as the case may be.

2.8 Special Reduction of Commitment. If all or any
portion of the Dunes Property is sold in a transaction
permitted by Section 6.3(b), the Commitment shall automatically
be reduced as of the date of such sale by the Special Commit-
ment Reduction Amount; provided that such reduction may be
deferred at the election of Borrowers for a period extending up

-51-

<PAGE>

to sixty (60) days after the later of (i) the date of such sale
or (ii) April 1, 1995 if (a) the sale of the Dunes Property is
for all Cash consideration and (b) the Net Cash Proceeds of
such sale are immediately pledged to the Administrative
Co-Agent pursuant to a blocked deposit account agreement in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Co-Agent until
the end of such period.

2.9 Optional Termination of Commitment. Following the
occurrence of a Change in Control, the Requisite Banks may in
their sole and absolute discretion elect, during the
thirty (30) day period immediately subsequent to the later of
(a) such occurrence or (b) the earlier of (i) receipt of
Borrowers' written notice to the Administrative Co-Agent of
such occurrence or (ii) if no such notice has been received by
the Administrative Co-Agent, the date upon which the
Administrative Co-Agent has actual knowledge thereof, to
terminate the Commitment, in which case the Commitment shall be
terminated effective on the date which is thirty (30) days
subsequent to written notice from the Administrative Co-Agent
to Borrowers thereof.

2.10 Administrative Co-Agent's Right to Assume Funds 
Available for Advances. Unless the Administrative Co-Agent
shall have been notified by any Bank no later than the Banking
Day prior to the funding by the Administrative Co-Agent of any 
Loan that such Bank does not intend to make available
to the Administrative Co-Agent such Bank's portion of the total
amount of such Loan, the Administrative Co-Agent may assume
that such Bank has made such amount available to the
Administrative Co-Agent on the date of the Loan and the 
Administrative Co-Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,
make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. If the
Administrative Co-Agent has made funds available to Borrowers
based on such assumption and such corresponding amount is not 
in fact made available to the Administrative Co-Agent by such
Bank, the Administrative Co-Agent shall be entitled to
recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Bank. If
such Bank does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith 
upon the Administrative Co-Agent's demand therefor, the
Administrative Co-Agent promptly shall notify Borrowers and
Borrowers shall pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Co-Agent. The Administrative Co-Agent also
shall be entitled to recover from such Bank interest on such
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative 
Co-Agent to Borrowers to the date such corresponding amount 
is recovered by the Administrative Co-Agent, at a rate per
annum equal to the daily Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to relieve any Bank from its obligation to
fulfill its share of the Commitment or to prejudice any
rights which the Administrative Co-Agent or Borrowers may have
against any Bank as a result of any default by such Bank
hereunder.

2.11 Swing Line. The Swing Line Bank shall from time 
to time through the day prior to the Maturity Date make Swing
Line Loans to Borrowers in such amounts as Borrowers may
request, provided that (i) giving effect to such Swing Line 
Loan, the Swing Line Outstandings do not exceed $10,000,000,
(ii) without the consent of all of the Banks, no Swing Line
Loan may be made during the continuation of an Event of Default 
and (iii) the Swing Line Bank has not given at least twenty-
four (24) hours prior notice to Borrowers that availability
under the Swing Line is suspended or terminated. Borrowers 
may borrow, repay and reborrow under this Section. Unless
notified to the contrary by the Swing Line Bank, borrowings 
under the Swing Line may be made in amounts which are
integral multiples of $100,000 upon telephonic request by a 
Responsible Official of Borrowers made to the Swing Line 
Bank not later than 3:00 p.m., Las Vegas time, on the Banking 
Day of the requested borrowing (which telephonic request shall 
be promptly confirmed in writing by telecopier). Promptly
after receipt of such a request for borrowing, the Swing 
Line Bank shall obtain telephonic verification from the
Administrative Co-Agent that, giving effect to such request, 
availability for Loans will exist under Section 2.1 (and 
such verification shall be promptly confirmed in writing by 
telecopier). Unless notified to the contrary by the Swing
Line Bank, each repayment of a Swing Line Loan shall be in an 
amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000. If
Borrowers instruct the Swing Line Bank to debit its demand 
deposit account at the Swing Line Bank in the amount of any 
payment with respect to a Swing Line Loan, or the Swing Line 
Bank otherwise receives repayment, after 3:00 p.m., Las Vegas 
time, on a Banking Day, such payment shall be deemed received 
on the next Banking Day. The Swing Line Bank shall promptly 
notify the Administrative Co-Agent of the Swing Loan 
Outstandings each time there is a change therein.

Swing Line Loans shall bear interest at a fluctuating
rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Alternate Base Rate Margin, payable on such dates,
not more frequent than monthly, as may be specified by the
Swing Line Bank and in any event on the Maturity Date. The
Swing Line Bank shall be responsible for invoicing Borrowers
for such interest. The interest payable on Swing Line Loans is
solely for the account of the Swing Line Bank.

The Swing Line Loans shall be payable on demand made
by the Swing Line Bank and in any event on the Maturity Date.

Upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Bank shall
be deemed to have purchased from the Swing Line Bank a partici-
pation therein in an amount equal to that Bank's Pro Rata Share
of the Commitment times the amount of the Swing Line Loan.
Upon demand made by the Swing Line Bank, each Bank shall,
according to its Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, promptly
provide to the Swing Line Bank its purchase price therefor in
an amount equal to its participation therein. The obligation
of each Bank to so provide its purchase price to the Swing Line
Bank shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by the occurrence of an Event of Default or any other
occurrence or event.

-53-

<PAGE>

In the event that the Swing Line Outstandings are in
excess of $5,000,000 on three (3) consecutive Banking Days,
then on the next Banking Day (unless Borrowers have made other
arrangements acceptable to the Swing Line Bank to reduce the
Swing Line Outstandings below $5,000,000), Borrowers shall
request a Committed Loan pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in an
amount complying with Section 2.1(d) and sufficient to reduce
the Swing Line Outstandings below $5,000,000. The
Administrative Co-Agent shall automatically provide such amount
to the Swing Line Bank (which the Swing Line Bank shall then
apply to the Swing Line Outstandings) and credit any balance of
the Committed Loan in immediately available funds to the
Designated Deposit Account. In the event that Borrowers fail
to request a Committed Loan within the time specified by
Section 2.2 on any such date, the Administrative Co-Agent may,
but is not required to, without notice to or the consent of
Borrowers, cause Committed Advances to be made by the Banks
under the Commitment in the amount necessary to comply with
Section 2.1(d) and sufficient to reduce the Swing Line
Outstandings below $5,000,000 and, for this purpose, the
conditions precedent set forth in Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3
shall not apply. The proceeds of such Committed Advances shall
be paid to the Swing Line Bank for application to the Swing
Line Outstandings.

(e) During the existence of a Default or Event of Default,
the Requisite Banks may determine that any or all then
outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be converted to
Alternate Base Rate Loans. Such conversion shall be effective
upon notice to Borrowers from the Requisite Banks (or from the
Administrative Co-Agent on behalf of the Requisite Banks) and

exceeds the Commitment shall be payable immediately and 
shall be applied to the Committed Advance Notes; and

shall in any event be payable on the Maturity Date.

(g) The Committed Advance Notes may, at any time and from
time to time, voluntarily be paid or prepaid in whole or in part 
without premium or penalty, except that with respect to any 
voluntary prepayment under this Section (i) any partial prepayment 
shall be not less than $5,000,000, (ii) the Administrative Co-Agent 
shall have received written notice of any prepayment by 9:00 a.m. 
San Francisco time on the date of prepayment (which must be a 
Banking Day) in the case of an Alternate Base Rate Loan, and, in the 
case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, three (3) Banking Days before the
date of prepayment, which notice shall identify the date and amount 

-56-

<PAGE>

of the prepayment and the Loan(s) being prepaid, (iii) each 
prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by payment of interest
accrued to the date of payment on the amount of principal paid and
(iv) any payment or prepayment of all or any part of any Eurodollar
Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the applicable 
Interest Period shall be subject to Section 3.8(d).

(h) No Competitive Advance Note may be prepaid without the
prior written consent of the Bank holding such Competitive Advance 
Note.

3.2 Arrangement Fee. On the Closing Date, Borrowers 
shall pay to the Arranger an arrangement fee in the amount 
heretofore agreed upon by letter agreement between Borrowers 
and the Arranger. Such arrangement fee is for the services 
of the Arranger in arranging the credit facilities under
this Agreement and is fully earned when paid. The arrangement
fee paid to the Arranger is solely for its own account and is
nonrefundable.

3.3 Upfront Fees. On the Closing Date, Borrowers shall 
pay to the Administrative Co-Agent, for the respective accounts 
of the Co-Agents, upfront fees in the respective amounts
heretofore agreed upon by letter agreement between Borrowers
and each Co-Agent. On the Closing Date, Borrowers shall
further pay to the Administrative Co-Agent, for the respective
accounts of the Banks (other than the Co-Agents) pro rata
according to their Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, an upfront
fee in an amount set forth in a letter from the Arranger to
each Bank and acknowledged by that Bank as the applicable
upfront fee for such Bank. Such upfront fees are for the
credit facilities committed by each Bank under this Agreement
and are fully earned when paid. The upfront fees paid to each
Bank are solely for its own account and are nonrefundable.

3.4 Commitment Fees. From the Closing Date, Borrowers 
shall pay to the Administrative Co-Agent, for the ratable 
accounts of the Banks pro rata according to their Pro Rata 
Share of the Commitment, a commitment fee equal to the 
Applicable Commitment Fee Rate per annum times the average 
daily amount by which the Commitment exceeds the sum of (a) 
the aggregate principal Indebtedness evidenced by the 
Committed Advance Notes (excluding the Competitive 
Advances and Swing Line Outstandings) plus (b) the Aggregate 
Effective Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding. The 
commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each 
Quarterly Payment Date and on the Maturity Date.

issuance of each Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall pay a letter 
of credit issuance fee to the Issuing Bank, for the sole 
account of the Issuing Bank, in an amount set forth in a 
letter agreement between Borrowers and the Issuing Bank. 
Borrowers shall also concurrently pay to the Administrative 
Co-Agent, for the ratable account of the Banks in accordance 
with their Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, a standby letter 
of credit fee in an amount equal to the Applicable Letter of 
Credit Fee times the face amount of such Letter of Credit

of credit fee are nonrefundable.

<PAGE>

3.6 Agency Fees. Borrowers shall pay to the 
Administrative Co-Agent an agency fee in such amounts and at 
such times as heretofore agreed upon by letter agreement 
between Borrowers and the Administrative Co-Agent. The agency 
fee is for the services to be performed by the Administrative 
Co-Agent in acting as Administrative Co-Agent and is fully 
earned on the date paid. The agency fee paid to the 
Administrative Co-Agent is solely for its own account and is 
nonrefundable.

3.7 Increased Commitment Costs. If any Bank shall 
determine in good faith that the introduction after the Closing 
Date of any applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline 
regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or any change 
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any central 
bank or other Governmental Agency charged with the 
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such 
Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) or any corporation 
controlling the Bank, with any request, guideline or 
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having 
the force of law) of any such central bank or other 
authority, affects or would affect the amount of capital 
required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any 
corporation controlling such Bank and (taking into con-
sideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with 
respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's desired return on 
capital) determines in good faith that the amount of such 
capital is increased, or the rate of return on capital is 
reduced, as a consequence of its obligations under this 
Agreement, then, within ten (10) Banking Days after demand of 
such Bank, Borrowers shall pay to such Bank, from time to 
time as specified in good faith by such Bank, additional 
amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank in light of such 
circumstances, to the extent reasonably allocable to such 
obligations under this Agreement. Each Bank's determination 
of such amounts shall be conclusive in the absence of 
manifest error.

3.8 Eurodollar Costs and Related Matters.

(a) If, after the date hereof, the existence or 
occurrence of any Special Eurodollar Circumstance:

(1) shall subject any Bank or its Eurodollar 
Lending Office to any tax, duty or other charge or 
cost with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance, 
any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans 
or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances,
or shall change the basis of taxation of payments 
to any Bank attributable to the principal of or 
interest on any Eurodollar Rate Advance or any 
other amounts due under this Agreement in respect 
of any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes
evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation 
to make Eurodollar Rate Advances, excluding, in the 
case of each Bank, the Administrative Co-Agent, 
each Co-Agent and each Eligible Assignee, and any 
Affiliate or Eurodollar Lending Office thereof, (i) 
taxes imposed on or measured in whole or in part
by its overall net income, gross income or gross 
receipts or capital and franchise taxes imposed on 
it, by (A) any jurisdiction (or political 
subdivision thereof) in which it is organized or 
maintains its principal office or Eurodollar
Lending Office or (B) any jurisdiction (or 
political subdivision thereof) in which it is 
"doing business" (unless it would not be doing 
business in such jurisdiction (or political sub-
division thereof) absent the transactions 
contemplated hereby), (ii) any withholding taxes or 
other taxes based on gross income imposed by the 
United States of America (other than withholding 
taxes and taxes based on gross income resulting 
from or attributable to any change in any law, rule
or regulation or any change in the interpretation 
or administration of any law, rule or regulation by 
any Governmental Agency) or (iii) any withholding 
taxes or other taxes based on gross income imposed 
by the United States of America for any period with 
respect to which it has failed to provide Borrowers 
with the appropriate form or forms required by 
Section 11.21, to the extent such forms are then 
required by applicable Laws;

(2) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any 
reserve not applicable or deemed applicable on the date 
hereof (including, without limitation, any reserve 
imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, but excluding the Eurodollar Reserve 
Percentage taken into account in calculating the 
Eurodollar Rate), special deposit, capital or similar
requirements against assets of, deposits with or for 
the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank or its 
Eurodollar Lending Office; or

-59-

<PAGE>

(3) shall impose on any Bank or its Eurodollar 
Lending Office or the Designated Eurodollar Market any 
other condition affecting any Eurodollar Rate Advance, 
any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans, its 
obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or this 
Agreement, or shall otherwise affect any of the same;

and the result of any of the foregoing, as determined in
good faith by such Bank, increases the cost to such Bank
or its Eurodollar Lending Office of making or maintaining
any Eurodollar Rate Advance or in respect of any
Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing
Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or reduces the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Bank or its Eurodollar
Lending Office with respect to any Eurodollar Rate
Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate
Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances
(assuming such Bank's Eurodollar Lending Office had
funded 100% of its Eurodollar Rate Advance in the Desig-
nated Eurodollar Market), then, within five (5) Banking
Days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the
Administrative Co-Agent), Borrowers shall pay to such
Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Bank for such increased cost or reduction
(determined as though such Bank's Eurodollar Lending
Office had funded 100% of its Eurodollar Rate Advance in
the Designated Eurodollar Market). Borrowers hereby
indemnify each Bank against, and agree to hold each Bank
harmless from and reimburse such Bank within
ten (10) Banking Days after demand for (without
duplication) all costs, expenses, claims, penalties,
liabilities, losses, reasonable legal fees and damages
incurred or sustained by each Bank in connection with
this Agreement, or any of the rights, obligations or
transactions provided for or contemplated herein, as a
direct result of the existence or occurrence of any
Special Eurodollar Circumstance. A statement of any Bank
claiming compensation under this subsection and setting
forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or
amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error. Each Bank agrees to
endeavor promptly to notify Borrowers of any event of
which it has actual knowledge, occurring after the Closing 
Date, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant 
to this Section, and agrees to designate a different 
Eurodollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid 
the need for or reduce the amount of such compensation and 
will not, in the good faith judgment of such Bank, other-
wise be materially disadvantageous to such Bank. If any 
Bank claims compensation under this Section, Borrowers 
may at any time, upon at least four (4) Eurodollar Banking 
Days' prior notice to the Administrative Co-Agent and such 
Bank and upon payment in full of the amounts provided for 
in this Section through the date of such payment plus any 
prepayment fee required by Section 3.8(d), pay in full the 
affected Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Bank or request 
that such Eurodollar Rate Advances be converted to Alternate 
Base Rate Advances.

-60-

<PAGE>

(b) If, after the date hereof, the existence or 
occurrence of any Special Eurodollar Circumstance shall, in 
the good faith opinion of any Bank, make it unlawful or 
impossible for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to 
make, maintain or fund its portion of any Eurodollar Rate 
Loan, or materially restrict the authority of such Bank to 
purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the 
Designated Eurodollar Market, or to determine or charge 
interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, and such Bank 
shall so notify the Administrative Co-Agent, then such 
Bank's obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be 
suspended for the duration of such illegality or 
impossibility and the Administrative Co-Agent forthwith
shall give notice thereof to the other Banks and Borrowers.
Upon receipt of such notice, the outstanding principal 
amount of such Bank's Eurodollar Rate Advances, together 
with accrued interest thereon, automatically shall be
converted to Alternate Base Rate Advances with Interest 
Periods corresponding to the Eurodollar Loans of which such 
Eurodollar Rate Advances were a part on either (1) the last 
day of the Eurodollar Period(s) applicable to such Euro-
dollar Rate Advances if such Bank may lawfully continue to 
maintain and fund such Eurodollar Rate Advances to such 
day(s) o r (2) immediately if such Bank may not lawfully 
continue to fund and maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances 
to such day(s), provided that in such event the conversion 
shall not be subject to payment of a prepayment fee under 
Section 3.8(d). Each Bank agrees to endeavor promptly to
notify Borrowers of any event of which it has actual 
knowledge, occurring after the Closing Date, which will 
cause that Bank to notify the Administrative Co-Agent under 
this Section 3.8(b), and agrees to designate a different 
Eurodollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the 
need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judg-
ment of such Bank, otherwise be materially disadvantageous 
to such Bank. In the event that any Bank is unable, for the 
reasons set forth above, to make, maintain or fund its 
portion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, such Bank shall fund 
such amount as an Alternate Base Rate Advance for the same 
period of time, and such amount shall be treated in all 
respects as an Alternate Base Rate Advance. Any Bank whose 
obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances has been 
suspended under this Section 3.8(b) shall promptly notify 
the Administrative Co-Agent and Borrowers of the cessation 
of the Special Eurodollar Circumstance which gave rise to 
such suspension.

(c) If, with respect to any proposed Eurodollar Rate 
Loan:

(1) the Administrative Co-Agent reasonably 
determines that, by reason of circumstances affecting
the Designated Eurodollar Market generally that are
beyond the reasonable control of the Banks, deposits 
in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being 
offered to any Bank in the Designated Eurodollar
Market for the applicable Eurodollar Period; or

(2) the Requisite Banks advise the Administrative
Co-Agent that the Eurodollar Rate as determined by the 
Administrative Co-Agent (i) does not represent the 
effective pricing to such Banks for deposits in 
Dollars in the Designated Eurodollar Market in the 
relevant amount for the applicable Eurodollar Period, 
or (ii) will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Banks of making the applicable Eurodollar
Rate Advances;

then the Administrative Co-Agent forthwith shall give
notice thereof to Borrowers and the Banks, whereupon
until the Administrative Co-Agent notifies Borrowers that
the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist, the obligation of the Banks to make any
future Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended. If
at the time of such notice there is then pending a
Request for Loan that specifies a Eurodollar Rate Loan,
such Request for Loan shall be deemed to specify an
Alternate Base Rate Loan.

(d) Upon payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate
Advance (other than as the result of a conversion required
under Section 3.1(e) or 3.8(b), on a day other than the last
day in the applicable Eurodollar Period (whether voluntarily,
involuntarily, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise), or
upon the failure of Borrowers (for a reason other than the
failure of a Bank to make an Advance) to borrow on the date or
in the amount specified for a Eurodollar Rate Loan in any
Request for Loan, Borrowers shall pay to the appropriate Bank
within ten (10) Banking Days after demand a prepayment fee or
failure to borrow fee, as the case may be (determined as though
100% of the Eurodollar Rate Advance had been funded in the
Designated Eurodollar Market) equal to the sum of:

-62-

<PAGE>

(1) the principal amount of the Eurodollar Rate
Advance prepaid or not borrowed, as the case may be,
times [the number of days between the date of prepay-
ment or failure to borrow, as applicable, and the last
day in the applicable Eurodollar Period], divided by 
360, times the applicable Interest Differential (pro-
vided that the product of the foregoing formula must
be a positive number); plus

(2) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Bank reasonably attributable to such payment, prepay-
ment or failure to borrow.

Each Bank's determination of the amount of any prepayment fee
payable under this Section 3.8(d) shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

3.9 Late Payments. If any installment of principal or
interest or any fee or cost or other amount payable under any
Loan Document to the Administrative Co-Agent or any Bank is not
paid when due, it shall thereafter bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
sum of the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Alternate
Base Rate Margin plus 2%, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due
amounts (including, without limitation, interest on past due
interest) shall be compounded monthly, on the last day of each
calendar month, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Laws.

3.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. Computation of
interest on Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be calculated on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
the actual number of days elapsed; computation of interest on
Eurodollar Rate Loans and all fees under this Agreement shall
be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual
number of days elapsed. Borrowers acknowledge that such latter
calculation method will result in a higher yield to the Banks
than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest
shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is
made; interest shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion
thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid.
Any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made
shall bear interest for one day.

3.11 Non-Banking Days. If any payment to be made by
Borrowers or any other Party under any Loan Document shall come
due on a day other than a Banking Day, payment shall instead be
considered due on the next succeeding Banking Day and the
extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest and
fees.

3.12 Manner and Treatment of Payments.

(a) Each payment hereunder (except payments
pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.7, 3.8, 11.3, 11.11 and
11.22) or on the Notes or under any other Loan Document
shall be made to the Administrative Co-Agent, at the
Administrative Co-Agent's Office, for the account of
each of the Banks or the Administrative Co-Agent, as
the case may be, in immediately available funds not later
than 11:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on the day of payment 
(which must be a Banking Day). All payments received after
11:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on any Banking Day, shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Banking Day. 
The amount of all payments received by the Administrative
Co-Agent for the account of each Bank shall be immediately
paid by the Administrative Co-Agent to the applicable
Bank in immediately available funds and, if such payment
was received by the Administrative Co-Agent by 11:00 a.m., 
San Francisco time, on a Banking Day and not so made
available to the account of a Bank on that Banking Day,
the Administrative Co-Agent shall reimburse that Bank for
the cost to such Bank of funding the amount of such pay-
ment at the Federal Funds Rate. All payments shall be made 
in lawful money of the United States of America.

(b) Each payment or prepayment on account of any
Committed Loan shall be applied pro rata according to the
outstanding Advances made by each Bank comprising such
Committed Loan. Each payment or (subject to Section
3.1(g)) prepayment on account of a Competitive Advance
shall be applied to the Competitive Advance Note held by
the Bank which made such Competitive Advance.

(c) Each Bank shall use its best efforts to keep a
record of Advances made by it and payments received by it
with respect to each of its Notes and, subject to Section
10.6(g), such record shall, as against Borrowers, be pre-
sumptive evidence of the amounts owing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, no Bank shall be liable to any
Party for any failure to keep such a record.

(d) Each payment of any amount payable by Borrowers 
or any other Party under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be made free and clear of, and without
reduction by reason of, any taxes, assessments or other
charges imposed by any Governmental Agency, central bank or
comparable authority, excluding, in the case of each Bank,
the Administrative Co-Agent, each Co-Agent and each Eligible
Assignee, and any Affiliate or Eurodollar Lending Office
thereof, (i) taxes imposed on or measured in whole or in

-64-

<PAGE>

part by its overall net income, gross income or gross
receipts or capital and franchise taxes imposed on it, by
(A) any jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in
which it is organized or maintains its principal office or
Eurodollar Lending Office or (B) any jurisdiction (or
political subdivision thereof) in which it is "doing
business" (unless it would not be doing business in such
jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) absent the
transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) any withholding
taxes or other taxes based on gross income imposed by the
United States of America (other than withholding taxes and
taxes based on gross income resulting from or attributable
to any change in any law, rule or regulation or any change
in the interpretation or administration of any law, rule or
regulation by any Governmental Agency) or (iii) any with-
holding taxes or other taxes based on gross income imposed
by the United States of America for any period with respect
to which it has failed to provide Borrowers with the
appropriate form or forms required by Section 11.21, to the
extent such forms are then required by applicable Laws (all
such non-excluded taxes, assessments or other charges being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). To the extent that
Borrowers are obligated by applicable Laws to make any 
deduction or withholding on account of Taxes from any amount
payable to any Bank under this Agreement, Borrowers shall 
(i) make such deduction or withholding and pay the same to
the relevant Governmental Agency and (ii) pay such
additional amount to that Bank as is necessary to result in
that Bank's receiving a net after-Tax amount equal to the
amount to which that Bank would have been entitled under
this Agreement absent such deduction or withholding. If
and when receipt of such payment results in an excess pay-
ment or credit to that Bank on account of such Taxes, that
Bank shall promptly refund such excess to Borrowers.

3.13 Funding Sources. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to obligate any Bank to obtain the funds for any Loan or
Advance in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Bank that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for any Loan or Advance in any particular place or
manner.

3.14 Failure to Charge Not Subsequent Waiver. Any 
decision by the Administrative Co-Agent or any Bank not to
require payment of any interest (including interest arising under
Section 3.9), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan
Document, or to calculate any amount payable by a particular 
method, on any occasion shall in no way limit or be deemed a
waiver of the Administrative Co-Agent's or such Bank's right to
require full payment of any interest (including interest arising
under Section 3.9), fee, cost or other amount payable under any
Loan Document, or to calculate an amount payable by another
method that is not inconsistent with this Agreement, on any other 
or subsequent occasion.

<PAGE>

3.15 Administrative Co-Agent's Right to Assume Payments
Will be Made by Borrowers. Unless the Administrative Co-Agent 
shall have been notified by Borrowers prior to the date on which 
any payment to be made by Borrowers hereunder is due that 
Borrowers do not intend to remit such payment, the Administrative 
Co-Agent may, in its discretion, assume that Borrowers have
remitted such payment when so due and the Administrative Co-
Agent may, in its discretion and in reliance upon such assump-
tion, make available to each Bank on such payment date an
amount equal to such Bank's share of such assumed payment. If
Borrowers have not in fact remitted such payment to the
Administrative Co-Agent, each Bank shall forthwith on demand
repay to the Administrative Co-Agent the amount of such assumed
payment made available to such Bank, together with interest
thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such
amount was made available by the Administrative Co-Agent to
such Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the
Administrative Co-Agent at the Federal Funds Rate.

3.16 Fee Determination Detail. The Administrative Co-
Agent, and any Bank, shall provide reasonable detail to 
Borrowers regarding the manner in which the amount of any payment 
to the Administrative Co-Agent and the Banks, or that Bank, 
under Article 3 has been determined, concurrently with demand 
forsuch payment.

3.17 Survivability. All of Borrowers' obligations 
under Sections 3.7 and 3.8 shall survive for ninety (90) days 
following the date on which the Commitment is terminated, all
Loans hereunder are fully paid and all Letters of Credit have
expired.

Officer to the Administrative Co-Agent or any Bank in connection 
with this Agreement, or in connection with any Loan, as of the date

Article 5
AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS
(OTHER THAN INFORMATION AND
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS)
_______________________

So long as any Advance remains unpaid, or any other
Obligation remains unpaid or unperformed, or any portion of the
Commitment remains in force, Borrowers shall, and shall cause
each of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, unless the
Administrative Co-Agent (with the written approval of the
Requisite Banks) otherwise consents:

5.1 Payment of Taxes and Other Potential Liens. Pay and
discharge promptly all taxes, assessments and governmental
charges or levies imposed upon any of them, upon their respec-
tive Property or any part thereof and upon their respective
income or profits or any part thereof, except that Borrowers
and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to pay or
cause to be paid (a) any tax, assessment, charge or levy that
is not yet past due, or is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings so long as the relevant entity has
established and maintains adequate reserves for the payment of
the same or (b) any immaterial tax so long as no material item
or portion of Property of Borrowers or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries is in jeopardy of being seized, levied upon or
forfeited.

5.2 Preservation of Existence. Preserve and maintain their
respective existences in the jurisdiction of their formation
and all material authorizations, rights, franchises,
privileges, consents, approvals, orders, licenses, permits, or
registrations from any Governmental Agency that are necessary
for the transaction of their respective business, except where
the failure to so preserve and maintain the existence of any
Restricted Subsidiary and such authorizations would not
constitute a Material Adverse Effect and except that a merger
permitted by Section 6.4 shall not constitute a violation of
this covenant; and qualify and remain qualified to transact
business in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is
necessary in view of their respective business or the ownership
or leasing of their respective Properties except where the
failure to so qualify or remain qualified would not constitute
a Material Adverse Effect.

protect all of their respective depreciable Properties in good
order and condition, subject to wear and tear in the ordinary
course of business, and not permit any waste of their respec-
tive Properties, except that the failure to maintain, preserve
and protect a particular item of depreciable Property that is
not of significant value, either intrinsically or to the
operations of Borrowers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, shall not constitute a violation of this covenant.

<PAGE>

5.4 Maintenance of Insurance. Maintain liability, casualty
and other insurance (subject to customary deductibles and
retentions) with responsible insurance companies in such
amounts and against such risks as is carried by responsible

insurance as may be required under the Deed of Trust and the
Mirage/TI Property Deed of Trust.

5.5 Compliance With Laws. Comply, within the time period,
if any, given for such compliance by the relevant Governmental
Agency or Agencies with enforcement authority, with all
Requirements of Law noncompliance with which constitutes a

obligations of the Administrative Co-Agent or the Banks and all
rights of Borrowers and any other Parties under the Loan
Documents shall be suspended without notice to or demand upon

-106-

<PAGE>

Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrowers, except that
all of the Banks or the Requisite Banks (as the case may be, in
accordance with Section 11.2) may waive an Event of Default or,
without waiving, determine, upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Banks or Requisite Banks, as the case may
be, to reinstate the Commitment and make further Advances,
which waiver or determination shall apply equally to, and shall
be binding upon, all the Banks;

(2) the Issuing Bank may, with the approval of the
Administrative Co-Agent on behalf of the Requisite Banks,
demand immediate payment by Borrowers of an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit to be
held by the Issuing Bank in an interest-bearing cash collateral
account as collateral hereunder; and

(3) the Requisite Banks may request the Administrative Co-
Agent to, and the Administrative Co-Agent thereupon shall,
terminate the Commitment and/or declare all or any part of the
unpaid principal of all Notes, all interest accrued and unpaid
thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents
to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the same shall
become and be forthwith due and payable, without protest,
presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of
any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrowers.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in
Section 9.1(k):

(1) the Commitment to make Advances, the obligation of the
Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit and all other
obligations of the Administrative Co-Agent or the Banks and all
rights of Borrowers and any other Parties under the Loan
Documents shall terminate without notice to or demand upon
Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrowers, except that
all the Banks may waive the Event of Default or, without
waiving, determine, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to
all the Banks, to reinstate the Commitment and make further
Advances, which determination shall apply equally to, and shall
be binding upon, all the Banks;

-107-

<PAGE>

(2) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit shall be immediately due and
payable to the Issuing Bank without notice to or demand upon
Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrower, to be held
by the Issuing Bank in an interest-bearing cash collateral
account as collateral hereunder; and

(3) the unpaid principal of all Notes, all interest accrued
and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan
Documents shall be forthwith due and payable, without protest,
presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of
any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrowers.

(c) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Banks
and the Administrative Co-Agent, or any of them, without notice

(except as to notices expressly provided for in any Loan
Document), may proceed (but only with the consent of the
Requisite Banks) to protect, exercise and enforce their rights
and remedies under the Loan Documents against Borrowers and any
other Party and such other rights and remedies as are provided
by Law or equity.

(d) The order and manner in which the Banks' rights and
remedies are to be exercised shall be determined by the
Requisite Banks in their sole discretion, and all payments
received by the Administrative Co-Agent and the Banks, or any
of them, shall be applied first to the costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and the
reasonably allocated costs of attorneys employed by the
Administrative Co-Agent or by any Bank) of the Administrative
Co-Agent and of the Banks, and thereafter paid pro rata to the
Banks in the same proportions that the aggregate Obligations
owed to each Bank under the Loan Documents bear to the
aggregate Obligations owed under the Loan Documents to all the
Banks, without priority or preference among the Banks. Regard-
less of how each Bank may treat payments for the purpose of its
own accounting, for the purpose of computing Borrowers'
Obligations hereunder and under the Notes, payments shall be
applied first, to the costs and expenses of the Administrative
Co-Agent and the Banks, as set forth above, second, to the
payment of accrued and unpaid interest due under any Loan
Documents to and including the date of such application
(ratably, and without duplication, according to the accrued and
unpaid interest due under each of the Loan Documents), and
third, to the payment of all other amounts (including principal
and fees) then owing to the Administrative Co-Agent or the

-108-

<PAGE>

Banks under the Loan Documents. Amounts due to a Bank under a
Secured Swap Agreement shall be considered a principal amount
for purposes of the preceding sentence. No application of
payments will cure any Event of Default, or prevent
acceleration, or continued acceleration, of amounts payable
under the Loan Documents, or prevent the exercise, or continued
exercise, of rights or remedies of the Banks hereunder or
thereunder or at Law or in equity.

Article 10
THE ADMINISTRATIVE CO-AGENT
___________________________

10.1 Appointment and Authorization. Subject to Section 10.8,
each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Co-Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as
are delegated to the Administrative Co-Agent by the terms
thereof or are reasonably incidental, as determined by the
Administrative Co-Agent, thereto. This appointment and
authorization is intended solely for the purpose of facili-
tating the servicing of the Loans and does not constitute
appointment of the Administrative Co-Agent as trustee for any
Bank or as representative of any Bank for any other purpose
and, except as specifically set forth in the Loan Documents to
the contrary, the Administrative Co-Agent shall take such
action and exercise such powers only in an administrative and
ministerial capacity.

10.2 Administrative Co-Agent and Affiliates. Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association (and each successor
Administrative Co-Agent) has the same rights and powers under
the Loan Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same
as though it were not the Administrative Co-Agent, and the term
"Bank" or "Banks" includes Bank of America National Trust and
Savings Association in its individual capacity. Bank of
America National Trust and Savings Association (and each
successor Administrative Co-Agent) and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust or other business with Borrowers, any
Subsidiary thereof, or any Affiliate of Borrowers or any
Subsidiary thereof, as if it were not the Administrative Co-
Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Banks.
Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (and
each successor Administrative Co-Agent) need not account to any
other Bank for any monies received by it for reimbursement of
its costs and expenses as Administrative Co-Agent hereunder, or
for any monies received by it in its capacity as a Bank
hereunder. The Administrative Co-Agent shall not be deemed to
hold a fiduciary relationship with any Bank and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise
exist against the Administrative Co-Agent.

10.3 Proportionate Interest in any Collateral. The
Administrative Co-Agent, on behalf of all the Banks, shall hold
in accordance with the Loan Documents all items of any
collateral or interests therein received or held by the
Administrative Co-Agent. Subject to the Administrative
Co-Agent's and the Banks' rights to reimbursement for their

-110-

<PAGE>

costs and expenses hereunder (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and disbursements and other professional services and the
reasonably allocated costs of attorneys employed by the
Administrative Co-Agent or a Bank) and subject to the
application of payments in accordance with Section 9.2(d), each
Bank shall have an interest in the Banks' interest in the
Collateral or interests therein in the same proportions that
the aggregate Obligations owed such Bank under the Loan
Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations owed under the Loan
Documents to all the Banks, without priority or preference
among the Banks.

10.4 Banks' Credit Decisions. Each Bank agrees that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Co-
Agent, any other Bank or the directors, officers, agents,
employees or attorneys of the Administrative Co-Agent or of any
other Bank, and instead in reliance upon information supplied
to it by or on behalf of Borrowers and upon such other
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own inde-
pendent credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Bank also agrees that it shall, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Co-Agent, any
other Bank or the directors, officers, agents, employees or
attorneys of the Administrative Co-Agent or of any other Bank,
continue to make its own independent credit analyses and deci-
sions in acting or not acting under the Loan Documents.

10.5 Action by Administrative Co-Agent.

(a) Absent actual knowledge of the Administrative
Co-Agent of the existence of a Default, the Administrative
Co-Agent may assume that no Default has occurred and is
continuing, unless the Administrative Co-Agent (or the Bank
that is then the Administrative Co-Agent) has received notice
from Borrowers stating the nature of the Default or has
received notice from a Bank stating the nature of the Default
and that such Bank considers the Default to have occurred and
to be continuing.

(b) The Administrative Co-Agent has only those
obligations under the Loan Documents as are expressly set forth
therein.

(c) Except for any obligation expressly set forth in
the Loan Documents and as long as the Administrative Co-Agent
may assume that no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Administrative Co-Agent may, but shall not be
required to, exercise its discretion to act or not act, except
that the Administrative Co-Agent shall be required to act or

-111-

<PAGE>

not act upon the instructions of the Requisite Banks (or of all
the Banks, to the extent required by Section 11.2) and those
instructions shall be binding upon the Administrative Co-Agent
and all the Banks, provided that the Administrative Co-Agent
shall not be required to act or not act if to do so would be
contrary to any Loan Document or to applicable Law or would
result, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative
Co-Agent, in substantial risk of liability to the
Administrative Co-Agent.

(d) If the Administrative Co-Agent has received a
notice specified in clause (a), the Administrative Co-Agent
shall immediately give notice thereof to the Banks and shall
act or not act upon the instructions of the Requisite Banks (or
of all the Banks, to the extent required by Section 11.2),
provided that the Administrative Co-Agent shall not be required
to act or not act if to do so would be contrary to any Loan
Document or to applicable Law or would result, in the
reasonable judgment of the Administrative Co-Agent, in
substantial risk of liability to the Administrative Co-Agent,
and except that if the Requisite Banks (or all the Banks, if
required under Section 11.2) fail, for five (5) Banking Days
after the receipt of notice from the Administrative Co-Agent,
to instruct the Administrative Co-Agent, then the
Administrative Co-Agent, in its sole discretion, may act or not
act as it deems advisable for the protection of the interests
of the Banks.

(e) The Administrative Co-Agent shall have no
liability to any Bank for acting, or not acting, as instructed
by the Requisite Banks (or all the Banks, if required under
Section 11.2), notwithstanding any other provision hereof.

10.6 Liability of Administrative Co-Agent. Neither the
Administrative Co-Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents, employees or attorneys shall be liable for any action
taken or not taken by them under or in connection with the Loan
Documents, except for their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation on the foregoing, the
Administrative Co-Agent and its directors, officers, agents,
employees and attorneys:

(a) May treat the payee of any Note as the holder
thereof until the Administrative Co-Agent receives notice of
the assignment or transfer thereof, in form satisfactory to the
Administrative Co-Agent, signed by the payee, and may treat
each Bank as the owner of that Bank's interest in the
Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement until the
Administrative Co-Agent receives notice of the assignment or
transfer thereof, in form satisfactory to the Administrative
Co-Agent, signed by that Bank.

-112-

<PAGE>

(b) May consult with legal counsel (including in-
house legal counsel), accountants (including in-house
accountants) and other professionals or experts selected by it,
or with legal counsel, accountants or other professionals or
experts for Borrowers and/or their Subsidiaries or the Banks,
and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in good faith in accordance with any advice of such legal
counsel, accountants or other professionals or experts.

(c) Shall not be responsible to any Bank for any
statement, warranty or representation made in any of the Loan
Documents or in any notice, certificate, report, request or
other statement (written or oral) given or made in connection
with any of the Loan Documents.

(d) Except to the extent expressly set forth in the
Loan Documents, shall have no duty to ask or inquire as to the
performance or observance by Borrowers or its Subsidiaries of
any of the terms, conditions or covenants of any of the Loan
Documents or to inspect any Collateral or the Property, books
or records of Borrowers or their Subsidiaries.

(e) Will not be responsible to any Bank for the due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
effectiveness, sufficiency or value of any Loan Document, any
other instrument or writing furnished pursuant thereto or in
connection therewith, or any Collateral.

(f) Will not incur any liability by acting or not
acting in reliance upon any Loan Document, notice, consent,
certificate, statement, request or other instrument or writing
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

(g) Will not incur any liability for any arithmetical 
error in computing any amount paid or payable by the
Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof or paid or
payable to or received or receivable from any Bank under any
Loan Document, including, without limitation, principal,
interest, commitment fees, Advances and other amounts; provided
that, promptly upon discovery of such an error in computation,
the Administrative Co-Agent, the Banks and (to the extent
applicable) Borrowers and/or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
shall make such adjustments as are necessary to correct such
error and to restore the parties to the position that they
would have occupied had the error not occurred.

-113-

<PAGE>

10.7 Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance
with its Pro Rata Share of the Commitment (if the Commitment is
then in effect) or in accordance with its proportion of the
aggregate Indebtedness then evidenced by the Notes (if the
Commitment has then been terminated), indemnify and hold the
Administrative Co-Agent and its directors, officers, agents,
employees and attorneys harmless against any and all liabili-
ties, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judg-
ments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees and disbursements and allocated costs of attorneys
employed by the Administrative Co-Agent) that may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against it or them in any way
relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents (other than
losses incurred by reason of the failure of Borrowers to pay
the Indebtedness represented by the Notes) or any action taken
or not taken by it as Administrative Co-Agent thereunder,
except such as result from its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation on the foregoing, each Bank
shall reimburse the Administrative Co-Agent upon demand for
that Bank's Pro Rata Share of any out-of-pocket cost or expense
incurred by the Administrative Co-Agent in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, amendment,
waiver, restructuring, reorganization (including a bankruptcy
reorganization), enforcement or attempted enforcement of the
Loan Documents, to the extent that Borrowers or any other Party
is required by Section 11.3 to pay that cost or expense but
fails to do so upon demand. Nothing in this Section 10.7 shall
entitle the Administrative Co-Agent to recover any amount from
the Banks if and to the extent that such amount has theretofore
been recovered from Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries. To
the extent that the Administrative Co-Agent is later reimbursed
such cost or expense by Borrowers or any of its Subsidiaries,
it shall return the amounts paid to it by the Banks in respect
of such cost or expense.

10.8 Successor Administrative Co-Agent. The Administrative
Co-Agent may, and at the request of the Requisite Banks shall,
resign as Administrative Co-Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice
to the Banks and Borrowers. If the Administrative Co-Agent
shall resign as Administrative Co-Agent under this Agreement,
the Requisite Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a
successor Administrative Co-Agent for the Banks, which
successor administrative co-agent shall be approved by
Borrowers (and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). If no successor administrative co-agent is
appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the

-114-

<PAGE>

Administrative Co-Agent, the Administrative Co-Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Borrowers, a
successor administrative co-agent from among the Banks. Upon
the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative
co-agent hereunder, such successor administrative co-agent
shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Administrative Co-Agent and the term "Administrative
Co-Agent" shall mean such successor administrative co-agent and
the retiring Administrative Co-Agent's appointment, powers and
duties as Administrative Co-Agent shall be terminated. After
any retiring Administrative Co-Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Co-Agent, the provisions of this Article 10, and
Sections 11.3, 11.11 and 11.22, shall inure to its benefit as
to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Co-Agent under this Agreement. If (a) the
Administrative Co-Agent has not been paid its agency fees under
Section 3.6 or has not been reimbursed for any expense
reimbursable to it under Section 11.3, in either case for a
period of at least one (1) year and (b) no successor
administrative co-agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Co-Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days
following a retiring Administrative Co-Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Administrative Co-Agent's resignation
shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Banks
shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Co-Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite Banks
appoint a successor administrative co-agent as provided for
above.

10.9 Foreclosure on Collateral. In the event of foreclosure
or enforcement of the Lien created by any of the Collateral
Documents, title to the Collateral covered thereby shall be
taken and held by the Administrative Co-Agent (or an Affiliate
or designee thereof) pro rata for the benefit of the Banks in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share of the Commitment and
shall be administered in accordance with the standard form of
collateral holding participation agreement used by the
Administrative Co-Agent in comparable syndicated credit
facilities.

10.10 No Obligations of Borrowers. Nothing contained in this
Article 10 shall be deemed to impose upon Borrowers any
obligation in respect of the due and punctual performance by
the Administrative Co-Agent of its obligations to the Banks
under any provision of this Agreement, and Borrowers shall have
no liability to the Administrative Co-Agent or any of the Banks
in respect of any failure by the Administrative Co-Agent or any
Bank to perform any of its obligations to the Administrative
Co-Agent or the Banks under this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, where any provision of this
Agreement relating to the payment of any amounts due and owing

-115-

<PAGE>

under the Loan Documents provides that such payments shall be
made by Borrowers to the Administrative Co-Agent for the
account of the Banks, Borrowers' obligations to the Banks in
respect of such payments shall be deemed to be satisfied upon
the making of such payments to the Administrative Co-Agent in
the manner provided by this Agreement.

Borrowers shall pay any and all documentary and other taxes,
excluding, in the case of each Bank, the Administrative
Co-Agent, each Co-Agent and each Eligible Assignee, and any
Affiliate or Eurodollar Lending Office thereof, (i) taxes
imposed on or measured in whole or in part by its overall net
income, gross income or gross receipts or capital and franchise
taxes imposed on it by (A) any jurisdiction (or political
subdivision thereof) in which it is organized or maintains its
principal office or Eurodollar Lending Office or (B) any
jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is
"doing business" (unless it would not be doing business in such
jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) absent the
transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) any withholding taxes
or other taxes based on gross income imposed by the United
States of America (other than withholding taxes and taxes based
on gross income resulting from or attributable to any change in
any law, rule or regulation or any change in the interpretation
or administration of any law, rule or regulation by any
Governmental Agency) or (iii) any withholding taxes or other
taxes based on gross income imposed by the United States of
America for any period with respect to which it has failed to
provide Borrowers with the appropriate form or forms required
by Section 11.21, to the extent such forms are then required by
applicable Laws, and all costs, expenses, fees and charges
payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
filing or recording of this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or any other instrument or writing to be delivered hereunder or
thereunder, or in connection with any transaction pursuant
hereto or thereto, and shall reimburse, hold harmless and
indemnify the Administrative Co-Agent and the Banks from and
against any and all loss, liability or legal or other expense
with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or fail-
ure to pay any such tax, cost, expense, fee or charge or that
any of them may suffer or incur by reason of the failure of any
Party to perform any of its Obligations. Any amount payable to
the Administrative Co-Agent or any Bank under this Section 11.3
shall bear interest from the second Banking Day following the
date of demand for payment at the Default Rate.

11.4 Nature of Banks' Obligations. The obligations of the
Banks hereunder are several and not joint or joint and several.
Nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
and no action taken by the Administrative Co-Agent or the Banks
or any of them pursuant hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed
to, make the Banks a partnership, an association, a joint
venture or other entity, either among themselves or with the
Borrowers or any Affiliate of any of Borrowers. Each Bank's
obligation to make any Advance pursuant hereto is several and
not joint or joint and several, and in the case of the initial
Advance only is conditioned upon the performance by all other
Banks of their obligations to make initial Advances. A default
by any Bank will not increase the Pro Rata Share of the
Commitment attributable to any other Bank. Any Bank not in
default may, if it desires, assume in such proportion as the
nondefaulting Banks agree the obligations of any Bank in
default, but is not obligated to do so. The Administrative
Co-Agent agrees that it will use its best efforts either to
induce the other Banks to assume the obligations of a Bank in
default or to obtain another Bank, reasonably satisfactory to
Borrowers, to replace such a Bank in default.

11.5 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties contained herein or in any other
Loan Document, or in any certificate or other writing delivered
by or on behalf of any one or more of the Parties to any Loan
Document, will survive the making of the Loans hereunder and
the execution and delivery of the Notes, and have been or will
be relied upon by the Administrative Co-Agent and each Bank,
notwithstanding any investigation made by the Administrative
Co-Agent or any Bank or on their behalf.

11.6 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Loan Documents, all notices, requests, demands, directions and
other communications provided for hereunder or under any other
Loan Document must be in writing and must be mailed,
telegraphed, telecopied, dispatched by commercial courier or
delivered to the appropriate party at the address set forth on
the signature pages of this Agreement or other applicable Loan
Document or, as to any party to any Loan Document, at any other
address as may be designated by it in a written notice sent to
all other parties to such Loan Document in accordance with this
Section 11.6. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any
Loan Document, if any notice, request, demand, direction or
other communication required or permitted by any Loan Document
is given by mail it will be effective on the earlier of receipt
or the third calendar day after deposit in the United States
mail with first class or airmail postage prepaid; if given by
telegraph or cable, when delivered to the telegraph company
with charges prepaid; if given by telecopier, when sent; if
dispatched by commercial courier, on the scheduled delivery
date; or if given by personal delivery, when delivered.

11.7 Execution of Loan Documents. Unless the Administrative
Co-Agent otherwise specifies with respect to any Loan Document,
(a) this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be executed
in any number of counterparts and any party hereto or thereto
may execute any counterpart, each of which when executed and
delivered will be deemed to be an original and all of which
counterparts of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, as
the case may be, when taken together will be deemed to be but
one and the same instrument and (b) execution of any such
counterpart may be evidenced by a telecopier transmission of
the signature of such party. The execution of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document by any party hereto or thereto will
not become effective until counterparts hereof or thereof, as
the case may be, have been executed by all the parties hereto
or thereto.

11.8 Binding Effect; Assignment.

(a) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
which Borrowers are a Party will be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Borrowers, the Administrative Co-Agent, each of
the Banks, and their respective successors and assigns, except
that, except as permitted in Section 6.4, Borrowers may not
assign their rights hereunder or thereunder or any interest
herein or therein without the prior written consent of all the
Banks. Each Bank represents that it is not acquiring its Note
with a view to the distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (subject to any
requirement that disposition of such Note must be within the
control of such Bank). Any Bank may at any time pledge its
Note or any other instrument evidencing its rights as a Bank
under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank, but no such
pledge shall release that Bank from its obligations hereunder
or grant to such Federal Reserve Bank the rights of a Bank
hereunder absent foreclosure of such pledge.

(b) From time to time following the Closing Date,
each Bank may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or
any portion of its Pro Rata Share of the Commitment; provided
that (i) such Eligible Assignee, if not then a Bank or an
Affiliate of the assigning Bank, shall be approved by each of
the Administrative Co-Agent and Borrowers (neither of which
approvals shall be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) such
assignment shall be evidenced by a Commitment Assignment and
Acceptance, a copy of which shall be furnished to the
Administrative Co-Agent as hereinbelow provided, (iii) except
in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of the assigning
Bank, to another Bank or of the entire remaining Commitment of
the assigning Bank, the assignment shall not assign a Pro Rata
Share of the Commitment equivalent to less than $10,000,000,
and (iv) the effective date of any such assignment shall be as
specified in the Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, but not
earlier than the date which is five (5) Banking Days after the
date the Administrative Co-Agent has received the Commitment
Assignment and Acceptance. Upon the effective date of such
Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee
named therein shall be a Bank for all purposes of this
Agreement, with the Pro Rata Share of the Commitment therein
set forth and, to the extent of such Pro Rata Share, the
assigning Bank shall be released from its further obligations
under this Agreement. Borrowers agree that they shall execute
and deliver (against delivery by the assigning Bank to
Borrowers of its Notes) to such assignee Bank, Notes evidencing
that assignee Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, and to
the assigning Bank, Notes evidencing the remaining balance Pro
Rata Share retained by the assigning Bank.

-121-

<PAGE>

(c) By executing and delivering a Commitment
Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee thereunder
acknowledges and agrees that: (i) other than the representation
and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
Pro Rata Share of the Commitment being assigned thereby free
and clear of any adverse claim, the assigning Bank has made no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made
in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness or sufficiency
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (ii) the
assigning Bank has made no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial
condition of Borrowers or the performance by Borrowers of the
Obligations; (iii) it has received a copy of this Agreement,
together with copies of the most recent financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into such Commitment Assignment
and Acceptance; (iv) it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Co-Agent or any Bank and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) it
appoints and authorizes the Administrative Co-Agent to take
such action and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as
are delegated to the Administrative Co-Agent by this Agreement;
and (vi) it will perform in accordance with their terms all of
the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Bank.

(d) The Administrative Co-Agent shall maintain at
the Administrative Co-Agent's Office a copy of each Commitment
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it. After receipt of a
completed Commitment Assignment and Acceptance executed by any
Bank and an Eligible Assignee, and receipt of an assignment fee
of $2,500 from such Eligible Assignee, the Administrative
Co-Agent shall, promptly following the effective date thereof,
provide to Borrowers and the Banks a revised Schedule 1.1
giving effect thereto.

-122-

<PAGE>

(e) Each Bank may from time to time grant
participations to one or more banks or other financial
institutions (including another Bank) in a portion of its Pro
Rata Share of the Commitment; provided, however, that (i) such
Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) the participating banks or other financial institutions
shall not be a Bank hereunder for any purpose except, if the
participation agreement so provides, for the purposes of
Sections 3.7, 3.8, 11.11 and 11.22 but only to the extent that
the cost of such benefits to Borrowers does not exceed the cost
which Borrowers would have incurred in respect of such Bank
absent the participation, (iv) Borrowers, the Administrative
Co-Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, (v) the participation
interest shall be expressed as a percentage of the granting
Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Commitment as it then exists and
shall not restrict an increase in the Commitment, or in the
granting Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, so long as
the amount of the participation interest is not affected
thereby and (vi) the consent of the holder of such par-
ticipation interest shall not be required for amendments or
waivers of provisions of the Loan Documents other than those
which (A) extend the Maturity Date or any other date upon which
any payment of money is due to the Banks, (B) reduce the rate
of interest on the Notes, any fee or any other monetary amount
payable to the Banks, (C) reduce the amount of any installment
of principal due under the Notes, (D) change the definition of
"Requisite Banks" or (E) release any material portion of the
Collateral.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.8 to
the contrary, the rights of the Banks to make assignments of,
and grant participations in, their Pro Rata Shares of the
Commitment shall be subject to the approval of any Gaming
Board, to the extent required by applicable Gaming Laws, and to
compliance with applicable securities laws.

11.9 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, the Administrative Co-Agent or any Bank (but in
each case only with the consent of the Requisite Banks) may
exercise its rights under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial
Code and other applicable Laws and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, apply any funds in any deposit account main-
tained with it by Borrowers and/or any Property of Borrowers in
its possession against the Obligations.

-123-

<PAGE>

11.10 Sharing of Setoffs. Each Bank severally agrees that if it,
through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or
counterclaim against Borrowers, or otherwise, receives payment
of the Obligations held by it that is ratably more than any
other Bank, through any means, receives in payment of the
Obligations held by that Bank, then, subject to applicable
Laws: (a) the Bank exercising the right of setoff, banker's
lien or counterclaim or otherwise receiving such payment shall
purchase, and shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased,
from the other Bank a participation in the Obligations held by
the other Bank and shall pay to the other Bank a purchase price
in an amount so that the share of the Obligations held by each
Bank after the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien
or counterclaim or receipt of payment shall be in the same
proportion that existed prior to the exercise of the right of
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment;
and (b) such other adjustments and purchases of participations
shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure
that all of the Banks share any payment obtained in respect of
the Obligations ratably in accordance with each Bank's share of
the Obligations immediately prior to, and without taking into
account, the payment; provided that, if all or any portion of a
disproportionate payment obtained as a result of the exercise
of the right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other
wise is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank by
Borrowers or any Person claiming through or succeeding to the
rights of Borrowers, the purchase of a participation shall be
rescinded and the purchase price thereof shall be restored to
the extent of the recovery, but without interest. Each Bank
that purchases a participation in the Obligations pursuant to
this Section 11.10 shall from and after the purchase have the
right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and
other communications under this Agreement with respect to the
portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as
though the purchasing Bank were the original owner of the
Obligations purchased. Borrowers expressly consent to the
foregoing arrangements and agree that any Bank holding a
participation in an Obligation so purchased may exercise any
and all rights of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim with
respect to the participation as fully as if the Bank were the
original owner of the Obligation purchased.

11.11 Indemnity by Borrowers. Borrowers agree to indemnify,
save and hold harmless the Administrative Co-Agent and each
Bank and their directors, officers, agents, attorneys and
employees (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against:
(a) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action
(except a claim, demand, action, or cause of action for any
amount excluded from the definition of "Taxes" in
Section 3.12(d)) if the claim, demand, action or cause of
action arises out of or relates to any act or omission (or
alleged act or omission) of Borrowers, their Affiliates or any
of their officers, directors or stockholders relating to the
Commitment, the use or contemplated use of proceeds of any

-124-

<PAGE>

Loan, or the relationship of Borrowers and the Banks under this
Agreement; (b) any administrative or investigative proceeding
by any Governmental Agency arising out of or related to a
claim, demand, action or cause of action described in
clause (a) above; and (c) any and all liabilities, losses,
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and the
reasonably allocated costs of attorneys employed by any
Indemnitee and disbursements of such attorneys and other
professional services) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as
a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand,
action or cause of action; provided that no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification for any loss caused by its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct or for any loss asserted
against it by another Indemnitee. If any claim, demand, action
or cause of action is asserted against any Indemnitee, such
Indemnitee shall promptly notify Borrowers, but the failure to
so promptly notify Borrowers shall not affect Borrowers'
obligations under this Section unless such failure materially
prejudices Borrowers' right to participate in the contest of
such claim, demand, action or cause of action, as hereinafter
provided. Such Indemnitee may (and shall, if requested by
Borrowers in writing) contest the validity, applicability and
amount of such claim, demand, action or cause of action and
shall permit Borrowers to participate in such contest. Any
Indemnitee that proposes to settle or compromise any claim or
proceeding for which Borrowers may be liable for payment of
indemnity hereunder shall give Borrowers written notice of the
terms of such proposed settlement or compromise reasonably in
advance of settling or compromising such claim or proceeding
and shall obtain Borrowers' prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). In connection with any
claim, demand, action or cause of action covered by this
Section 11.11 against more than one Indemnitee, all such Indem-
nitees shall be represented by the same legal counsel (which
may be a law firm engaged by the Indemnitees or attorneys
employed by an Indemnitee or a combination of the foregoing)
selected by the Indemnitees and reasonably acceptable to
Borrowers; provided, that if such legal counsel determines in
good faith that representing all such Indemnitees would or
could result in a conflict of interest under Laws or ethical
principles applicable to such legal counsel or that a defense
or counterclaim is available to an Indemnitee that is not
available to all such Indemnitees, then to the extent reason
ably necessary to avoid such a conflict of interest or to
permit unqualified assertion of such a defense or counterclaim,
each Indemnitee shall be entitled to separate representation by
legal counsel selected by that Indemnitee and reasonably
acceptable to Borrowers, with all such legal counsel using
reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort
by counsel for all Indemnitees; and further provided that the
Administrative Co-Agent (as an Indemnitee) shall at all times
be entitled to representation by separate legal counsel (which
may be a law firm or attorneys employed by the Administrative
Co-Agent or a combination of the foregoing). Any obligation or
liability of Borrowers to any Indemnitee under this
Section 11.11 shall survive the expiration or termination of
this Agreement and the repayment of all Loans and the payment
and performance of all other Obligations owed to the Banks.

-125-

<PAGE>

11.12 Nonliability of the Banks. Borrowers acknowledge and
agree that:

(a) Any inspections of any Property of
Borrowers made by or through the Administrative Co-Agent or
the Banks are for purposes of administration of the Loan only
and Borrowers are not entitled to rely upon the same (whether
or not such inspections are at the expense of Borrowers);

(b) By accepting or approving anything required to
be observed, performed, fulfilled or given to the
Administrative Co-Agent or the Banks pursuant to the Loan Docu-
ments, neither the Administrative Co-Agent nor the Banks shall
be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency,
legality, effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any
term, provision or condition thereof, and such acceptance or
approval thereof shall not constitute a warranty or
representation to anyone with respect thereto by the
Administrative Co-Agent or the Banks;

(c) The relationship between Borrowers and the
Administrative Co-Agent and the Banks is, and shall at all
times remain, solely that of borrowers and lenders; neither the
Administrative Co-Agent nor the Banks shall under any
circumstance be construed to be partners or joint venturers of
Borrowers or their Affiliates; neither the Administrative
Co-Agent nor the Banks shall under any circumstance be deemed
to be in a relationship of confidence or trust or a fiduciary
relationship with Borrowers or their Affiliates, or to owe any
fiduciary duty to Borrowers or their Affiliates; neither the
Administrative Co-Agent nor the Banks undertake or assume any
responsibility or duty to Borrowers or their Affiliates to
select, review, inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or
inform Borrowers or their Affiliates of any matter in connec-
tion with their Property or the operations of Borrowers or
their Affiliates; Borrowers and their Affiliates shall rely
entirely upon their own judgment with respect to such matters;
and any review, inspection, supervision, exercise of judgment
or supply of information undertaken or assumed by the
Administrative Co-Agent or the Banks in connection with such
matters is solely for the protection of the Administrative
Co-Agent and the Banks and neither Borrowers nor any other
Person is entitled to rely thereon; and

-126-

<PAGE>

(d) The Administrative Co-Agent and the Banks shall
not be responsible or liable to any Person for any loss,
damage, liability or claim of any kind relating to injury or
death to Persons or damage to Property caused by the actions,
inaction or negligence of Borrowers and/or its Affiliates and
Borrowers hereby indemnify and hold the Administrative Co-Agent
and the Banks harmless from any such loss, damage, liability or
claim.

11.13 No Third Parties Benefited. This Agreement is made for
the purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations,
rights and duties of Borrowers, the Administrative Co-Agent and
the Banks in connection with the Loans, and is made for the
sole benefit of Borrowers, the Administrative Co-Agent and the
Banks, and the Administrative Co-Agent's and the Banks'
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Sections 11.8
and 11.11, no other Person shall have any rights of any nature
hereunder or by reason hereof.

11.14 Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees to hold any
confidential information that it may receive from Borrowers
pursuant to this Agreement in confidence, except for disclo-
sure: (a) to other Banks; (b) to legal counsel and accountants
for Borrowers or any Bank; (c) to other professional advisors
to Borrowers or any Bank, provided that the recipient has accep-
ted such information subject to a confidentiality agreement
substantially similar to this Section 11.14; (d) to regulatory
officials having jurisdiction over that Bank; (e) to any Gaming
Board having regulatory jurisdiction over Parent or its
Subsidiaries, provided that each Bank agrees to use its best
efforts to notify Borrowers of any such disclosure unless
prohibited by applicable Laws; (f) as required by Law or legal
process or in connection with any legal proceeding to which
that Bank and any of Borrowers are adverse parties; and (g) to
another financial institution in connection with a disposition
or proposed disposition to that financial institution of all or
part of that Bank's interests hereunder or a participation
interest in its Note, provided that the recipient has accepted
such information subject to a confidentiality agreement
substantially similar to this Section 11.14. For purposes of
the foregoing, "confidential information" shall mean any
information respecting Parent or its Subsidiaries reasonably
considered by Borrowers to be confidential, other than
(i) information previously filed with any Governmental Agency
and available to the public, (ii) information previously
published in any public medium from a source other than,
directly or indirectly, that Bank, and (iii) information
previously disclosed by Borrowers to any Person not associated
with Borrowers without a confidentiality agreement or
obligation substantially similar to this Section 11.14. Noth-
ing in this Section shall be construed to create or give rise
to any fiduciary duty on the part of the Administrative
Co-Agent or the Banks to Borrowers.

-127-

<PAGE>

11.15 Further Assurances. Borrowers and the Restricted Subsidiaries
shall, at their expense and without expense to the Banks or the
Administrative Co-Agent, do, execute and deliver such further
acts and documents as any Bank or the Administrative Co-Agent
from time to time reasonably requires for the assuring and
confirming unto the Banks or the Administrative Co-Agent of the
rights hereby created or intended now or hereafter so to be, or
for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance
of the terms of any Loan Document.

11.16 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other
Loan Documents and the letter agreements referred to in
Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.5 and 11.3, comprises the complete and
integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on
the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other
Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control
and govern; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights
or remedies in favor of the Administrative Co-Agent or the
Banks in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict
with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the
joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall
be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but
rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

11.17 Governing Law. Except to the extent otherwise provided
therein, each Loan Document shall be governed by, and construed
and enforced in accordance with, the local Laws of Nevada.

11.18 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan
Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable or
invalid as to any party or in any jurisdiction shall, as to
that party or jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable or
invalid without affecting the remaining provisions or the
operation, enforceability or validity of that provision as to
any other party or in any other jurisdiction, and to this end
the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be
severable.

11.19 Headings. Article and Section headings in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are included for convenience of
reference only and are not part of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents for any other purpose.

<PAGE>

11.20 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of the
Loan Documents.

11.21 Foreign Banks and Participants. Each Bank, and each
holder of a participation interest herein, that is incorporated
or otherwise organized under the Laws of a jurisdiction other
than the United States of America or any State thereof or the
District of Columbia shall deliver to Borrowers (with a copy to
the Administrative Co-Agent), within twenty (20) days after the
Closing Date (or after accepting an assignment or receiving a
participation interest herein pursuant to Section 11.8, if
applicable) two duly completed copies, signed by a Responsible
Official, of either Form 1001 (relating to such Person and
entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding on all
payments to be made to such Person by Borrowers pursuant to
this Agreement) or Form 4224 (relating to all payments to be
made to such Person by the Borrowers pursuant to this
Agreement) of the United States Internal Revenue Service or
such other evidence (including, if reasonably necessary,
Form W-9) satisfactory to Borrowers and the Administrative
Co-Agent that no withholding under the federal income tax laws
is required with respect to such Person. Thereafter and from
time to time, each such Person shall (a) promptly submit to
Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Co-Agent), such
additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such
forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to
time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may
then be available under then current United States laws and
regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to
Borrowers and the Administrative Co-Agent of any available
exemption from, United States withholding taxes in respect of
all payments to be made to such Person by Borrowers pursuant to
this Agreement and (b) take such steps as shall not be
materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of
such Bank, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the
re-designation of its Eurodollar Lending Office, if any) to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that Borrowers make
any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to
such Person.

11.22 Hazardous Material Indemnity. Each of Borrowers hereby
agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend (by counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Co-Agent) the
Administrative Co-Agent and each of the Banks and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors
and assigns from and against any and all claims, losses,
damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, charges, administrative
and judicial proceedings and orders, judgments, remedial action
requirements, enforcement actions of any kind, and all costs
and expenses incurred in connection therewith (including but
not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and the reasonably
allocated costs of attorneys employed by the Administrative
Co-Agent or any Bank, and expenses to the extent that the

-129-

<PAGE>

defense of any such action has not been assumed by Borrowers),
arising directly or indirectly out of (i) the presence on, in,
under or about any Real Property of any Hazardous Materials, or
any releases or discharges of any Hazardous Materials on, under
or from any Real Property and (ii) any activity carried on or
undertaken on or off any Real Property by Borrowers or any of
its predecessors in title, whether prior to or during the term
of this Agreement, and whether by Borrowers or any predecessor
in title or any employees, agents, contractors or subcon-
tractors of Borrowers or any predecessor in title, or any third
persons at any time occupying or present on any Real Property,
in connection with the handling, treatment, removal, storage,
decontamination, clean-up, transport or disposal of any
Hazardous Materials at any time located or present on, in,
under or about any Real Property. The foregoing indemnity
shall further apply to any residual contamination on, in, under
or about any Real Property, or affecting any natural resources,
and to any contamination of any Property or natural resources
arising in connection with the generation, use, handling,
storage, transport or disposal of any such Hazardous Materials,
and irrespective of whether any of such activities were or will
be undertaken in accordance with applicable Laws, but the
foregoing indemnity shall not apply to Hazardous Materials on
any Real Property, the presence of which is caused by the
Administrative Co-Agent or the Banks. Borrowers hereby
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to the
contrary, the obligations of Borrowers under this Section (and
under Sections 4.18 and 5.13) shall be unlimited corporate
obligations of Borrowers and shall not be secured by any deed
of trust on any Real Property.

11.23 Gaming Boards. The Administrative Co-Agent and each of
the Banks agree to cooperate with all Gaming Boards in connec-
tion with the administration of their regulatory jurisdiction
over Borrowers and its Subsidiaries, including the provision of
such documents or other information as may be requested by any
such Gaming Board relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or to the Loan Documents.

11.24 Joint and Several. Each of Borrowers shall be obligated
for all of the Obligations on a joint and several basis,
notwithstanding which of Borrowers may have directly received
the proceeds of any particular Loan or the benefit of a
particular Letter of Credit. Each of Borrowers acknowledges
and agrees that, for purposes of the Loan Documents, Borrowers
constitute a single integrated financial enterprise and that
each receives a benefit from the availability of credit under
this Agreement to all of Borrowers. Each of Borrowers waive
all defenses arising under the Laws of suretyship, to the
extent such Laws are applicable, in connection with its joint
and several obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, each of Borrowers agrees to the Joint Borrower
Provisions set forth in Exhibit O, incorporated by this
reference.

11.25 Removal of a Bank. Borrowers shall have the right to
remove a Bank as a party to this Agreement if such Bank objects
(pursuant to Section 6.5(b)(i)) to the use of Committed Loans
in connection with the acquisition by Borrowers of certain
voting interests in a corporation or business entity under the
circumstances described in Section 6.5. Upon notice from
Borrowers, such Bank shall execute and deliver a Commitment

Borrowers may designate, subject to (a) payment in full by such
Eligible Assignee of all principal, interest and fees owing to
such Bank through the date of assignment and (b) delivery by
such Eligible Assignee of such appropriate assurances and
indemnities (which may include letters of credit) as such Bank
may reasonably require with respect to its participation
interest in any Letters of Credit then outstanding or any Swing
Line Outstandings. Alternatively, Borrowers may reduce the
Commitment pursuant to Section 2.6 (and, for this purpose, the
numerical requirements of such Section shall not apply) by an
amount equal to that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Commitment,
pay and provide to such Bank the amounts, assurances and
indemnities described in (a) and (b) above and release such
Bank from its Pro Rata Share of the Commitment.
