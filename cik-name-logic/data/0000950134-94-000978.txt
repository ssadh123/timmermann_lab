INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

The Board of Directors
Investark Bankshares, Inc.
Stuttgart, Arkansas

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Investark Bankshares, Inc.
and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three year period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Investark
Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries, at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three year period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1: Summary of significant accounting policies

The accounting principles and reporting policies followed by Investark
Bankshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") conform with
generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices
within the financial services industry. The following is a description
of the more significant of these policies:

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries, First Stuttgart Bank and Trust Company
(formerly First National Bank in Stuttgart), Stuttgart, Arkansas (100%
owned) and of The Bank of North Arkansas, Melbourne, Arkansas (99.7%
owned). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated.

Cash flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash and due from banks, and federal funds sold.

Investment securities

Investment securities, except for investments in mutual funds, are
stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts. Investments in mutual funds are carried at the lower of
cost or market. Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities
are computed using the specific identification method.

Allowance for loan losses

The allowance for loan losses is established through charges to expense
and is maintained at a level which, in management's judgement, is
necessary to provide for future losses from the current portfolios.
This judgement is based on analysis of the current and expected
economic conditions, risk characteristics of the loan portfolios and
prior loan loss experience in relation to loans outstanding.

Interest on loans

Interest on installment loans is recognized as income over the lives of
the loans by the sum-of-the-months-digits and simple interest methods.
The results of using the sum-of-the-months-digits method do not differ
materially from those obtained by using the interest method. Interest
on other loans is recognized based on the principal amounts
outstanding. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when, in
the opinion of management, there is doubt as to the ability of the
borrower to pay interest or principal. The balances of non-accrual
loans were $474,067 and $446,379 at December 31, 1993 and 1992.
Interest previously accrued but uncollected on these loans was $148,031
and $51,142 at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1: Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the
straight-line method.

Real estate owned other than premises

Real estate owned other than premises consists primarily of property
acquired in settlement of loans These properties are initially
recorded at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by appraisal
at the date acquired. Losses arising from such acquisitions are
charged to the allowance for loan losses. Carrying values are
subsequently reduced through a charge to operations when current
appraisals indicate a decline in value. Fair value is based on the
estimated net amount realizable on disposition of the property.
Amounts included in other assets at December 31, 1993 and 1992, were
$142,874 and $1,241,534, respectively.

Income taxes

Provisions for income taxes are based on amounts reported in the
statements of income (after exclusion of non-taxable income such as
interest on state and municipal securities) and include deferred taxes
on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for
tax and financial statement purposes. Deferred taxes are computed
using the liability method as prescribed in SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes."

Off-balance-sheet financial instruments

In the ordinary course of business the Company has entered into
off-balance-sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to
extend credit, commitments under credit card arrangements, commercial
letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial
instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become
payable.

Trust Department assets

In accordance with the usual practice of banks, property other than
cash deposits held by the Company's subsidiary bank's Trust Department
in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers, is not included in the
consolidated financial statements.

Reclassification

Certain 1992 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1993
presentation.

1992 and 1991, respectively.

Note 6: Leases

First Stuttgart Bank is lessor of computer equipment under
operating leases which expire during 1994. Minimum future rental
payments receivable under these noncancellable leases are:

1994 $38,368

The lessees are to provide all maintenance to the equipment under
the terms of the leases.

Note 7: Income taxes

</TABLE>
The income tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily
because of the income tax treatment of exempt income and provision
for loan losses and use of alternative minimum tax credits.

Note 8: Employee benefit plans

First Stuttgart Bank has a defined benefit pension plan which
covers substantially all its employees. The benefits are based on
years of service and the employee's compensation during the last
five years of employment. The funding policy is to contribute
annually an amount that does not exceed the maximum amount
deductible for federal income tax purposes. Contributions are
intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to
date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

The following tables set forth the plan's funded status and
amounts recognized in the Bank's balance sheet at December 31,
1993 and 1992 (amounts in thousands):

The weighted-average discount rate and the rate of increase in

present value of the projected benefit obligation were 7.0 % and
4.5% respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on
assets was 7.0%.

In connection with the merger with First United Bancshares, First
Stuttgart Bank is to terminate its defined benefit plan during
1994. Under generally accepted accounting principles, if the net
effect of the termination is a loss, it should be recognized when
the termination is probable and the effects are reasonably
estimable. Accordingly, a loss of $215,000 on the termination of
this plan is included in the accompanying 1993 statement of
income.

The Bank of North Arkansas has a defined contribution employee
benefit plan, qualified under IRC Section 401(k) that covers all
employees, with the exception of employees who are highly
compensated. Contributions to the plan are based on the total
amount of salary reduction the employee elects to defer, a
discretionary matching contribution equal to a percentage of the
amount the employee elects to defer, which percentage will be
determined each year by the employer, and a discretionary amount
determined each year by the employer. To share in the matching
and discretionary contribution, the employee must complete a year
of service and be actively employed on the last day of the Plan
Year. The amount of pension expense was $13,345 and $15,606 for
1993 and 1992, respectively.

Note 9: Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and due from banks and short-term investments: 
For these short-term items, the carrying amount is a 
reasonable estimate of fair value.

Investment securities: 
Fair values are based on quoted market prices, if 
available. If a quoted market price is not available, 
fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for 
similar securities.

Loans:
The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the
expected future cash flows using current rates at which
similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings and for similar remaining maturities.

Deposit liabilities:
The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and
certain money market deposits is the amount payable on
demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-
maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the
rates currently offered for deposits with similar
remaining maturities.

Borrowed funds:
For borrowings with fixed interest rates, fair value is
estimated using the rates currently available to the
Company's subsidiary banks for debt with similar terms
and remaining maturities. For floating rate debt the
fair value approximates the recorded liability.

Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit:
The fair value of commitments is estimated using the
fees currently charged to enter into similar
arrangements, taking into account the remaining terms of
the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the
counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, fair
value also considers the difference between current
levels of interest rates and committed rates. The fair
value of letters of credit is based on the fees
currently charged for similar agreements or on the
estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the
obligations with the counterparties at the reporting
date.

Note 11: Commitments and contingencies

The consolidated financial statements do not reflect various
commitments and contingent liabilities which arise in the normal
course of the Company's business and which involve elements of
credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. These
commitments and contingent liabilities consist of commitments to
extend credit and letters of credit. A summary of the commitments
and contingent liabilities at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are
summarized below:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
1993 1992

<S> <C> <C>
Commitments to extend credit $18,411,675 $15,725,759

Letters of credit 646,938 472,038
----------- -----------
$22,284,395 $18,846,737
=========== ===========

</TABLE>
Commitments to extend credit, credit card arrangements and letters
of credit all include some exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance of the customer. The Company's credit policies
and procedures for credit commitments and financial guarantees are
the same as those for extensions of credit that are recorded in
the consolidated financial statements. Because these instruments
have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them expire without
being drawn upon, they do not generally present any significant
liquidity risk to the Company.
<PAGE> 30
INVESTARK BANKSHARES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 11: Commitments and contingencies (continued)

In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal
proceedings involving the Company and its subsidiaries, most of
which are considered litigation incidental to the conduct of
business. These proceedings include, among other matters,
defense of routine corporate, employment, banking and lender
liability related litigation. Management, after consulting with
legal counsel and based on the facts available and proceedings to
date, some of which are preliminary, is of the opinion that the
ultimate resolution of these proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
Company.

Note 12: Concentrations of credit

Substantially all of the Company's loans, commitments to loan and
letters of credit have been granted to customers in their trade
area who are also depositors of the Company. The concentrations
of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 3. The
distribution of commitments to extend credit approximates the
distribution of loans outstanding.

Note 13: Dividend restrictions

As State Banks, First Stuttgart Bank and The Bank of North
Arkansas are each restricted in the amount of dividends they may
pay in any year without prior permission from the Arkansas Bank
Commissioner to fifty percent of its net income for the year. The
Banks' ability to pay dividends is also restricted by the minimum
capital requirement of their regulatory agencies which require
them to maintain at least an 8.25% risk-based capital ratio.

Note 14: Related party transactions

Some of the directors and executive officers and the companies in
which they had a significant interest were customers of and had
transactions with the Company's subsidiary banks. Such
transactions were made in the ordinary course of the Banks'
business on substantially the same terms and conditions, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same
time for comparable transactions with other customers and did not,
in the opinion of management, involve more than a normal credit
risk or present other unfavorable features. The aggregate amount
of loans to such related parties amounted to $2,212,481 and
$3,345,252 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Transactions during 1993 included new loans amounting to
$2,459,497 and repayments amounting to $3,592,268.

Note 15: Supplemental cash flow information

The Company paid $5,166,679 and $7,031,918 in interest on deposits
and other borrowings during 1993 and 1992, respectively, and
income taxes of $289,000 and $470,000 for 1993 and 1992.

Note 16: Pending merger

On December 17, 1993 the Company entered into an agreement to
merge with First United Bancshares, Inc. of El Dorado, Arkansas.
Under the terms of this agreement First United would acquire all
of the outstanding stock of Investark Bankshares, Inc. through
issuance of First United common stock valued at approximately
$26,125,000. This transaction is expected to be consummated in
the first half of 1994.

Note 17: Effects of recently adopted accounting standards

During 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued SFAS No. 114 (Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan) which becomes effective beginning in 1995. This statement
requires that impaired loans that are within the scope of the
Statement essentially be measured based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective
rate, or as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market
price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent. Management has not determined the effect
this statement will have when adopted.

In 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS NO. 115, (Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities), that becomes effective for fiscal years
beginning after 1993. This Statement addresses the accounting and
reporting for investments in certain debt and equity securities.
Debt securities not classified as trading account securities or
investment securities expected to be held to maturity and all
equity securities will be classified as available for sale and are
reported at fair value, with net unrealized gains and losses
reported, net of tax, as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Investark will apply the new rules starting in the first
quarter of 1994 and believes the impact of adopting this statement
will not be material to its financial position or results of
operations.
