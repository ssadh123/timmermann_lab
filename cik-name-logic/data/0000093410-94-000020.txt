Exhibit 99

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and 
Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 38
through 53 of the 1993 Annual Report to the Stockholders of Chevron
Corporation and the restated earnings per share amounts included in Item 5 of
this Form 8-K, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 1992, the company changed its methods of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions and for income taxes.

restated earnings per share amounts 
included in Item 5 of this Form 8-K,
which is as of May 11, 1994.
