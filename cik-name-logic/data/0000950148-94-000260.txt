THE FOOTHILL GROUP, INC. REPORTS

RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS 

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, April 18, 1994 . . . The
Foothill Group, Inc. (NYSE-FGI) today reported a 280% increase in net
income for the first quarter ended March 31, 1994 to a record
$11,442,000, or 65 cents per fully diluted share, compared with income
from continuing operations of $3,009,000, or 18 cents per fully
diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 1993. Foothill
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $1.20 for the year ended December 31, 1993.

Henry K. Jordan, Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, said, "The Company's return on average assets and
average equity for the first quarter ended March 31, 1994 totaled
8.07% and 32.70%, respectively, as compared to 2.73% and 10.55% for
the quarter ended March 31, 1993. First quarter results reflected
significant revenue contributions from money management activities,
continued strong interest margins and improved credit quality of the
asset-based loan portfolio. Interest margin, as a percent of average
assets, was 7.03% for the 1994 first quarter, compared with 6.96% for
the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1993. Asset based 

<PAGE> 9
loans reached $520,697,000 as of March 31, 1994, up from 
$514,518,000 as of December 31, 1993.

"The Company reported $4,718,000 in gains from sales
of bank loans during the 1994 first quarter versus $1,126,000 in the
first quarter of 1993. Gain on investments, which include profits
from both Foothill Capital Corporation and from managed partnerships,
were $10,146,000 in the 1994 first quarter versus $179,000 in the
first quarter of 1993. The previously reported January 1994 sale of
the Company's debt and equity positions in G. Heileman Brewing
Company, Inc., was primarily responsible for the significant results
noted above.

"The Company's level of nonperforming finance 
receivables and repossessed assets totaled $15,382,000, or
2.95% of finance receivables and repossessed assets as of March 31,
1994, down from $16,296,000 or 3.17% of finance receivables and
repossessed assets as of December 31, 1993.

"Equity and purchased bank debt positions owned by
the Company have unrealized gains totaling $40,952,000 as of March 31,
1994, up from $37,805,000 as of December 31, 1993. In addition,
investments of Foothill's managed partnerships show substantial
unrealized gains which, if realized, may contribute to future
earnings.

"Book value per common share was $9.71 as of March
31, 1994, up from $9.02 as of December 31, 1993. Total stockholders'
equity increased in the 1994 first quarter to a record $164 million.

"We anticipate profits from asset-based lending
activities at Foothill Capital Corporation during the balance of 1994
will remain strong. We expect gains from the sale of bank loans and
profits from managed partnerships to be realized sporadically during
the balance of 1994, as was the case during 1993. The Company
believes that the consensus of analysts' earnings estimates for
Foothill for 1994 are reasonable."

The Foothill Group, Inc. is a specialized financial 
services company which operates two tightly linked businesses:
commercial lending and money management.
