FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BALLY MANUFACTURING WINS SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL TO CHANGE COMPANY'S
NAME TO BALLY ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION

Chicago, IL, May 17, 1994 -- Arthur M. Goldberg, Chairman, CEO
and President of Bally Manufacturing Corporation (NYSE:BLY),
announced today the approval by Bally's shareholders to change the
name of the leading casino and fitness center operator to Bally
Entertainment Corporation.
Goldberg explained, "Bally's new name more accurately
illustrates the company's success in the operation of world-class
casinos.
"Since our divestiture from all but our core businesses in
1990, Bally is no longer in the manufacturing business. As a
result, Bally Entertainment Corporation is a stronger name that
reflects the current and future direction of the company."
Goldberg said that, "Further evidence of our commitment to the
entertainment industry includes the company's investment in Tunica,
Mississippi, New Orleans and other new gaming jurisdictions."
Most recently Bally received licensing approval for its Belle
of Orleans riverboat in New Orleans, Louisiana. This transaction
followed the successful grand opening of the company's first water-
based casino, Bally's Gambling Hall & Saloon in Tunica, Mississippi
last December.
Bally Manufacturing Corporation is one of the world's foremost
operators of casinos and casino hotel resorts. The company owns and
operates three world-class casino hotel and resorts in Atlantic City
and Las Vegas, a dockside casino in Tunica, Mississippi and is in
the process of building a riverboat casino in New Orleans, Louisiana
to be opened in early 1995.
Bally through its subsidiary, Bally's Health & Tennis, is also
the world's largest commercial operator of fitness centers with
approximately 350 facilities in the U.S. and Canada.
