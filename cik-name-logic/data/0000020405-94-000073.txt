Item 5. Other Events

On October 18, 1994 Citicorp reported net income of $894
million, or $1.67 per common share, a record for any quarter. 

These earnings compared with $528 million, or $0.97 cents per
share, in the 1993 third quarter and $877 million, or $1.64 per
share, in the 1994 second quarter.

In the 1994 nine months, net income was $2.3 billion, or
$4.33 per share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.05 per share,
in the same 1993 period. 

John S. Reed, Citicorp Chairman, commented: "The excellent
quarterly and nine month results showed the strength of the
global franchise and our consumer businesses. Trading revenues
were up from the second quarter and back to more normal levels
but below last year." 

He added: "Return on common equity was 25% for the nine
months and we further strengthened the balance sheet. Total
capital now exceeds $25 billion, reserves are over $5 billion and
asset quality continues to improve."

Adjusted revenues in the third quarter, also a record,
totaled $4.6 billion, up 8% from the 1994 second quarter and 3%
from the same 1993 quarter -- or up 5% and 9%, respectively,
excluding trading. (Adjusted revenues exclude credit-related
costs, the effect of credit card securitization and capital
building transactions.) Trading revenues in the third quarter
amounted to $287 million, up from $159 million in the 1994 second
quarter but well below the strong 1993 third quarter revenues of
$478 million. 

Operating expenses (adjusted to exclude the cost of Other
Real Estate Owned) were $2.6 billion, up 6% from the 1994 second
quarter and 5% from the same 1993 quarter. Major factors in the
increases from the 1993 quarter were continued expansion of
businesses in emerging markets, marketing spending in card
businesses around the world and continued investments in
operational efficiencies.

Improvement in credit portfolios continued, with a decline
in the quarter of commercial cash-basis loans and OREO by $360
million to $4.3 billion. Commercial credit costs were $40
million, compared with $73 million in the 1994 second quarter and
$233 million in the 1993 third quarter. Consumer credit costs
also decreased in the quarter, totaling $544 million, compared
with $585 million in the 1994 second quarter and $665 million in
the 1993 third quarter. 

Return on common equity (excluding accounting changes)
continued to improve, rising to 26.5% for the quarter and 25.2%
for the nine months, compared with 19.2% and 16.9% for the same
1993 periods. Return on total stockholders' equity in the
quarter was 22.0%. 

The company continued to strengthen its balance sheet. Total
regulatory capital at September 30, 1994 was $25.4 billion,
estimated to be 11.7% of risk-adjusted assets, and the Tier 1
capital ratio increased to an estimated 7.3% from 7.1% at the end
of the 1994 second quarter. At September 30, 1993, the total
capital ratio was 10.7% and the Tier 1 ratio was 6.2%.

Loan loss reserves were built by $100 million in the quarter
to $5.1 billion at September 30, 1994, compared with $4.3 billion
at September 30, 1993. 

The effective tax rate for current operations in the first
nine months was reduced to 34% from the 37% reported in the first
six months of 1994 and from 42% in the first nine months of 1993,
reflecting an improved level and mix of earnings in the current
year. 

CORE BUSINESS RESULTS

Global Consumer

Net income for the Global Consumer businesses in the third
quarter reached a record $477 million, compared with $349 million
in the 1993 third quarter and $411 million in the 1994 second
quarter. Credit costs in North America continued to improve,
particularly in the U.S. credit card business, while revenues in
the emerging economies increased 23% over the same 1993 quarter. 

In the first nine months, net income was $1.3 billion,
compared with $936 million in the same 1993 period.

The consumer businesses in North America, Europe and Japan
earned $308 million in the quarter, compared with $216 million in
the same 1993 quarter and $250 million in the 1994 second
quarter. Consumer businesses in the emerging economies earned
$169 million, compared with $133 million in the 1993 third
quarter and $161 million in the 1994 second quarter.

Adjusted revenues of $2.9 billion in the quarter grew 5%
from the same 1993 quarter and 4% from the 1994 second quarter. 
The improvements over the 1993 quarter were due to higher net
interest revenue and fees in the emerging economies, with the
improvement over the 1994 second quarter reflecting higher net
interest revenue in the U.S. credit card business and in emerging
economies.

New pricing strategies for credit cards resulted in managed
U.S. receivables of $35 billion at September 30, 1994, up $2.4
billion, or 7%, from September 30, 1993; total accounts of 22
million, up 2.6 million, or 14%, from September 30, 1993; and
total charge volumes in the quarter of $18 billion, up $3.5
billion, or 24%, from the same 1993 quarter.

Operating expenses rose 3% from the 1993 third quarter and
4% from the 1994 second quarter due to spending to grow the U.S.
credit card and emerging economies businesses.

Total consumer credit costs (adjusted principally for the
effect of credit card securitization) declined by $121 million
from the 1993 third quarter, due primarily to further improvement
in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Consumer cash-basis loans
fell to $2.7 billion from $2.8 billion at the end of the 1994
second quarter and $3.0 billion at the end of the 1993 third
quarter. OREO declined in the quarter by $407 million to $787
million, primarily reflecting a portfolio sale at approximately
book value.

Global Finance

The Global Finance businesses' net income improved to $433
million in the third quarter, compared with $383 million in the
same 1993 quarter and $284 million in the 1994 second quarter.

The businesses in North America, Europe and Japan earned
$181 million in the quarter, compared with $220 million in the
same 1993 quarter and $103 million in the 1994 second quarter. 
Important factors in the results were the return to more normal
levels of trading revenues and improvements in credit-related
items.

The businesses in the emerging economies reported net income
of $252 million in the third quarter, up from $163 million in the
same 1993 quarter and $181 million in the 1994 second quarter. 
The earnings improvements reflected higher net interest revenues
in Latin America from a favorable rate environment during the
quarter, with broad-based increases in fee revenues also
contributing to the improvement over the 1993 third quarter.

Global Finance adjusted revenues were $1.5 billion in the
third quarter, compared with $1.5 billion also in the same 1993
quarter and $1.2 billion in the 1994 second quarter. Excluding
trading revenues, which declined in the quarter from the
unusually high levels of 1993, revenues were up 16% from the same
1993 quarter, led by increases in the emerging economies. 

Adjusted operating expenses of $905 million in the third
quarter, compared with $816 million in the same 1993 quarter and
$823 million in the 1994 second quarter. The increases reflected
continued business expansion in the emerging economies, selective
investment spending in North America, Europe and Japan and,
compared with the 1994 second quarter, higher compensation
related to trading activities.

Credit recoveries and gains from the sale of OREO properties
contributed to a positive net credit amount of $60 million in the
third quarter, compared with an $88 million charge in the same
1993 period.

Cash-basis loans of $534 million at September 30, 1994, 
compared with $581 million at the end of the 1994 second quarter
and $1.1 billion a year earlier. 

OTHER AREAS

North America Commercial Real Estate

North America Commercial Real Estate reported continued
progress in dealing with its portfolio. Cash-basis loans of $1.3
billion were down from $1.5 billion at the end of the 1994 second
quarter and from $2.1 billion at the end of the 1993 third
quarter. OREO totaled $1.8 billion at the end of the 1994 third
quarter, down from $1.9 billion at the end of the 1994 second
quarter and $2.6 billion at September 30, 1993. Total exposure
was reduced by approximately $500 million during the quarter, to
$11.2 billion, down $3.5 billion from the 1993 third quarter.

The decreases resulted from various restructurings, sales,
write-offs, writedowns and paydowns. 

North America Commercial Real Estate reported a net loss of
$86 million in the third quarter and $232 million in the nine
months, a reduction from the net losses of $132 million and $519
million in the comparable 1993 periods. The decrease in losses
reflected lower credit-related costs.

Cross-Border Refinancing Portfolio

The cross-border refinancing portfolio reported net income
of $45 million in the third quarter and $147 million in the nine
months, compared with $26 million and $77 million in the
comparable 1993 periods, primarily reflecting higher revenues. 
Additionally, the 1994 nine month results benefited from a $44
million release of reserves in the first half of the year.

Cash-basis loans totaled $140 million at September 30, 1994,
compared with $165 million at the end of the second quarter and
$1.1 billion at September 30, 1993. The reduction in cash-basis
loans from a year ago reflected primarily the effects of the
Brazil refinancing agreement completed in the second quarter of
1994.

Following are tables of financial highlights, an analysis of
operating margin and pretax earnings, business results and credit
indicators, along with financial statements. Further details
concerning the financial results will be available in Citicorp's
Form 10-Q to be published in November.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET NOTES (continued)

(B) Balances at September 30, 1994 include the effect of adopting
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities". Statement No. 115, which requires that 
securities designated as "available for sale" be carried at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in
stockholders' equity (net of applicable taxes) was adopted
effective January 1, 1994. Pursuant to the adoption of
SFAS No. 115, "Brady Bonds" previously included as 
Commercial Loans are classified as Held to Maturity
and Available for Sale Securities.

(C) Trading Account Assets and Trading Account Liabilities as of
September 30, 1994 include approximately $17.5 billion 
relating to the adoption in 1994 of Financial Accounting 
Standards Board Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts
Related to Certain Contracts". Interpretation No. 39 requires
that unrealized trading gains and losses be reported gross 
on the balance sheet except where there is a qualifying
netting agreement in place. On a pro-forma basis, Trading
Account Assets and Trading Account Liabilities as of
December 31, 1993 would have been $36.8 billion and $18.5
billion, respectively, had the new rule been in effect on
that date. Amounts presented for Trading Account Assets and
Trading Account Liabilities as of December 31, 1993 include 
the reclassification of $5.7 billion and $3.1 billion,
respectively, to provide for consistent presentation of, 
amounts previously recorded in Other Assets and Other
Liabilities representing revaluation gains and losses and
other balances related to these contracts.
