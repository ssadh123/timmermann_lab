Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
Bedford Property Investors, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying Historical Summary of Gross
Income and Direct Operating Expenses (the Summary) of Dupont
Industrial Center (the Property) for the year ended December 31,
1993. The Summary is the responsibility of the Property's owner.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Summary based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the Summary. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall Summary
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

The accompanying Summary was prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the current Report on Form
8-K of Bedford Property Investors, Inc.) and excludes certain
expenses, described in note A, that would not be comparable to
those resulting from the proposed future operations of the
Property.

In our opinion, the Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the gross income and direct operating
expenses, exclusive of expenses described in note A, of Dupont
Industrial Center for the year ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Historical Summary of Gross Income and Direct Operating
Expenses

A. Property and Basis of Accounting
The Historical Summary of Gross Income and Direct Operating
Expenses has been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14 of
Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
relates to the operations of Dupont Industrial Center, a
suburban industrial complex located in Ontario, California,
with approximately 452,000 rental square feet.

In accordance with Rule 3-14, direct operating expenses are
presented exclusive of depreciation, interest, management fees
and income taxes as these expenses would not be comparable to
the proposed future operations of the property.

The acquisition of the property may result in a new valuation
for purposes of determining future property tax assessments.

Rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the
terms of the related leases. For 1993, the aggregate
contractual rentals exceeded rental income by $43,457.
