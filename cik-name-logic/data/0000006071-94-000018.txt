ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

As reported in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
January 29, 1994, which was filed on April 29, 1994, Ames 
Department Stores, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an 
agreement on April 28, 1994 with BankAmerica Business 
Credit, Inc., as agent, and a syndicate consisting of seven 
other banks and financial institutions, for a secured 
revolving credit facility of up to $300 million (the "New 
Facility"). The New Facility has a sublimit of $100 million 
for letters of credit. A copy of the New Facility is 
attached as Exhibit 4 and is incorporated by reference 
herein.

Management believes that the New Facility contains terms, 
covenants and interest rates that are generally more 
favorable than those in the credit agreement in effect since 
the Company's emergence from bankruptcy and in its current 
letter of credit facility. The New Facility expires on the 
third anniversary from the initial Advance (as defined in 
the New Facility). A summary of the material features of 
the New Facility is set forth in the Company's January 29, 
1994 Form 10-K (Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements).

As a result of the refinancing, the Company is expected to 
report, in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending 
January 28, 1995 ("Fiscal 1995"), a non-cash extraordinary 
charge of approximately $2.3 million, before any tax 
benefit, relating to the extinguishment of debt. In 
addition, as a consequence of, among other things, the 
refinancing, the benefit to the Company from the Wertheim 
settlement (Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements), an expected non-cash income tax provision, and 
stock appreciation rights expense accruals, the Company 
anticipates filing a revised Fiscal 1995 summary financial 
plan on a Form 8-K in late May or early June, 1994. The 
Company currently anticipates that the net effect of all of 
the above adjustments, including the extraordinary charge, 
will not result in a material change in the projected net
income for the year as presented in the Form 8-K dated 
February 17, 1994.

on or after the Closing Date and before the Maturity Date, such 
Lender's pro rata share of such borrowings as may be requested or be 
deemed requested by any Borrower in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement (each such borrowing made by any Borrower, a "Revolving 
Advance" and the outstanding principal balance of all Revolving 
Advances from time to time, the "Revolving Loan"), in each case 
subject to the limitations contained in Section 2.2 hereof.

(b) Each Revolving Advance shall be made on the date 
specified in the Written Notice as described in Section 2.4(a) 
hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any Borrower shall be deemed to 
request a Revolving Advance under Section 3.4 hereof, no notice of a 
borrowing by such Borrower shall be necessary and such Revolving 
Advance shall be in the amount of the reimbursement obligation of 
such Borrower for the drawing made under the Letter of Credit for 
which such Revolving Advance is deemed requested. Each Revolving 
Advance shall be either a Reference Rate Advance or a Eurodollar 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Advance, or a combination thereof, as the applicable Borrower shall 
request, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this 
Agreement. Any portion of a Revolving Advance which shall be a 
Eurodollar Advance shall be in an amount equal to $10,000,000 or any 
greater integral multiple of $1,000,000.

2.2. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COMMITMENT AND BORROWING 
LIMIT. (a) No Revolving Advance shall be made to any Borrower and 
no Letter of Credit shall be issued for the account of any Borrower 
if, after giving effect to such Revolving Advance or Letter of 
Credit:

(i) the sum of (x): 

(A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the 
Revolving Advances made to all Borrowers, plus 

(B) the aggregate unpaid amount of the Letter of 
Credit Obligations of all Borrowers, less

(C) in the case of any Revolving Advance to be

Obligation to be satisfied with the proceeds of such 
Revolving Advance,

or (ii),

except in the case of any Revolving Advance to be made under 
Section 3.4 hereof to which the limitations set forth in 
this clause (ii) shall not apply,

the sum of (x): 

(A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the 
Revolving Advances of such Borrower, plus 

(B) the aggregate unpaid amount of the Letter of 
Credit Obligations of such Borrower, 

shall exceed (y) an amount (as to such Borrower, the 
"Borrowing Limit") equal to the sum of (A) such Borrower's 
Borrowing Base LESS (B) an amount equal to that portion of 
the Reinstated Debt Reserve at such time that is apportioned 
to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent in its 
discretion, LESS (C) an amount equal to all other reserves 
which any Agent in good faith based on collateral 
considerations deems in its sole discretion to be necessary 
or appropriate to maintain with respect to the account of 
such Borrower, including, without limitation, shrinkage 
reserves (to the extent shrinkage is not otherwise accounted 
for in such Borrower's Borrowing Base) and any amounts which 
any Agent or any Lender may be obligated to pay in the 
future for the account of such Borrower.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for Revolving 
Advances to be made under Section 3.4 hereof and Revolving Advances 
in excess of the limitations contained in Section 4.1(b)(ii) (but not 
in excess of the limitations contained in Section 4.1(b)(i)) hereof 
made pursuant to an election of the Administrative Agent under 
Section 7.2 hereof and as to which no contrary Direction Letter has 
been received by the Administrative Agent, no Revolving Advance shall 
be made if, after giving effect to the making of such Revolving 
Advance, the Borrowers would be required under Section 4.1(b) hereof 
to make a prepayment or provide Letter of Credit Cash Collateral.

(c) Subject to the limitations of Sections 2 and 4 hereof, 
each Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow the Revolving Loan. The 
portion of the Revolving Loan to be funded by each Lender to the 
Borrowers shall not exceed in aggregate principal amount at any one 
time outstanding, and no Lender shall have any obligation to fund its 
pro rata share of any Revolving Advance if after giving effect 
thereto the outstanding portions of Revolving Advances made by such 
Lender plus the pro rata share of such Lender's Letter of Credit 
Obligations shall be in the aggregate in excess of, the revolving 
commitment amount set forth opposite such Lender's name on Exhibit A 
hereto for the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment, as reduced from 
time to time (for each Lender, its "Revolving Commitment").

2.3. NOTES. (a) The pro rata portion of the Revolving 
Advances made by each Lender to the Borrowers shall be evidenced by, 
and be repayable with interest in accordance with the terms of, a 
promissory note issued by each Borrower payable to the order of such 
Lender, which shall be in the maximum principal amount of such 
Lender's Revolving Commitment. Each Note shall be in the form of 
Exhibit 2.3(a) hereto (together with any replacement, modification, 
renewal or substitution thereof, individually, a "Note" and 
collectively, the "Notes").

(b) Each Note shall be dated the Closing Date and be duly 
completed, executed and delivered by the applicable Borrower.

(c) Each of the Notes shall mature on the Maturity Date (or 
earlier as hereinafter provided), and shall be subject to payment and 
prepayment as provided in Sections 2 and 4 hereof.

2.4. NOTICE OF BORROWING; BORROWER'S CERTIFICATE. (a) 
Whenever any Borrower desires to make a borrowing of a Revolving 
Advance (other than the initial Revolving Advance), it shall give the 
Administrative Agent, at its address set forth in Section 13.4 
hereof, not later than 12:00 noon (New York time), at least three (3) 
Business Days' prior Written Notice (or on the same Business Day as 
the Business Day of such Written Notice in the case of a Revolving 
Advance which shall be a Reference Rate Advance) from an Authorized 
Representative (which notice shall be irrevocable and shall 
conclusively evidence the obligation of such Borrower to repay such 
Revolving Advance) of its desire to make a borrowing of a Revolving 
Advance. The Borrowers shall give to the Administrative Agent such 
prior Written Notice of the initial Revolving Advance as shall be

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Each notice of borrowing 
under this Section 2.4(a) shall be substantially in the form of 
Exhibit 2.4(a) hereto (each a "Borrower's Certificate"). If such 
notice shall be with respect to a borrowing of a Eurodollar Advance 
but fails to state an applicable Interest Period therefor, then such 
notice shall be deemed to be a request for a one-month Interest 
Period. If (x) the applicable Borrower shall fail to state in any 
such notice whether such Revolving Advance shall be a Reference Rate 
Advance or a Eurodollar Advance or (y) the applicable Borrower shall 
be deemed to make a borrowing of a Revolving Advance pursuant to 
Section 3 hereof, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected 
a Reference Rate Advance. Subject to the other provisions of this 
Agreement, Advances of more than one type may be outstanding at the 
same time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no more than five (5) Eurodollar 
Advances in the aggregate may be outstanding at any one time. The 
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the Administrative 
Agent's receipt of any request for the making or renewal of or 
conversion to a Eurodollar Advance. Such notice shall be given on 
the same day such request is received by the Administrative Agent if 
received prior to 12:00 noon on such Business Day, and otherwise on 
the next Business Day. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) no Borrower shall be permitted to 
make a borrowing request hereunder during any Cleanup Period and (ii) 
no Borrower shall be permitted to select a borrowing of or conversion 
into a Eurodollar Advance in any Borrower's Certificate or Written 
Notice, as applicable, (x) to the extent such selection would be 
prohibited by Section 2.10 or Section 2.11 hereof, (y) if a Default 
or an Event of Default shall be in existence as of the date of 
selection or commencement of the applicable Interest Period or (z) to 
the extent that such proposed Eurodollar Advance would constitute a 
Tranche B Advance.

(c) On the Closing Date, and, subject to Section 2.4(e) 
hereof and Section 7 hereof, on each subsequent date on which a 
Revolving Advance is made, each Lender shall make available to the 
Administrative Agent such Lender's pro rata portion of the Revolving 
Advance to be made on the date specified in the aforementioned notice 
(which for purposes of Revolving Advances made pursuant to Section 3 
hereof shall be deemed to be the Business Day after receipt of the 
written or telephonic notice by the Administrative Agent to each such 
Lender of such borrowing) not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) 
on such specified date in U.S. dollars in immediately available 
funds, at the account of the Administrative Agent located at The 
Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 4 Chase Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, New 
York 11245, ABA #021 000 021, for the account of BankAmerica Business 
Credit, Inc., Account Number 910-2-640704, Reference: Ames, or such 
other account as the Administrative Agent may from time to time 
direct (the "Payment Account"). The portion of each Revolving 
Advance to be funded by each Lender shall be such Lender's pro rata 
share thereof.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(d) Except for Revolving Advances made pursuant to Section 
3.4 hereof (which Revolving Advances shall be applied to the 
reimbursement of drawings under the Letter of Credit for which such 
Revolving Advance was made in accordance with such Section 3 hereof), 
proceeds of each Revolving Advance received by the Administrative 
Agent shall be made available to the applicable Borrower by the 
Administrative Agent at the Disbursement Account of such Borrower 
upon satisfaction of all applicable conditions.

(e) It is agreed that each Lender's funded portion of the 
Revolving Loan is intended by the Lenders to be equal at all times to 
such Lender's pro rata share of the outstanding Revolving Loan. 
Notwithstanding such agreement, the Administrative Agent, BABC and 
the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit 
of or enforceable by any Credit Party) that in order to facilitate 
the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, 
settlement among them as to the Revolving Loan shall, subject to the 
provisions of clause (f) below, take place on a periodic basis in 
accordance with the following provisions:

(i) To the extent and in the manner hereinafter provided 
in this Section 2.4(e), settlement among the Lenders as to the 
Revolving Loan shall occur on each Settlement Date, which may 
occur before or after the occurrence or during the continuance of 
a Default or Event of Default and whether or not all or any of 
the conditions to the making of any Revolving Advance set forth 
in Section 6 or 7 would be met if determined on such Settlement 
Date. On each Settlement Date, payments shall be made to the 
Administrative Agent for the account of BABC or the Lenders, as 
the case may be, in the manner provided in this Section 2.4(e) 
and in accordance with the Settlement Report delivered by the 
Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 
2.4(e) in respect of such Settlement Date, so that as of each 
Settlement Date, and after giving effect to the transactions on 
such Settlement Date, each Lender's outstanding Revolving 
Advances shall equal such Lender's pro rata share of the 
outstanding Revolving Loan.

(ii) On each Settlement Date, the Administrative Agent 
shall deliver to each Lender a Settlement Report not later than 
12:00 noon (New York time), which Settlement Report shall be with 
respect to the period beginning on the next preceding Settlement 
Date and ending on such Settlement Date.

(iii) Between Settlement Dates, the Administrative Agent 
shall request and BABC as a Lender shall, subject to the 
provisions of clause (f) below and within the limits and subject 
to the conditions (except as contemplated by Section 7.2 hereof) 
of this Agreement, advance to the Borrowers out of BABC's own 
funds, the entire principal amount of any Revolving Advance 
requested or deemed requested pursuant to the terms of this 
Agreement (any such Revolving Advance being referred to as a 
"Non-Ratable Advance"). The making of each Non-Ratable Advance 
by BABC shall be deemed to be the making by each other Lender of 
such Lender's pro rata share of such Non-Ratable Advance and the 
concurrent purchase by BABC and a sale (without representation, 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
warranty or recourse) by each other Lender of a 100% 
participation in such pro rata share of such Non-Ratable Advance. 
All payments of principal, interest and any other amount with 
respect to such Non-Ratable Advance shall be payable to and 
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of BABC. 
Any payments received by the Administrative Agent between 
Settlement Dates which in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement are to be applied to the reduction of the outstanding 
principal balance of the Revolving Loan, shall be paid over to 
and retained by BABC for such application, and such payment to 
and retention by BABC shall be deemed, to the extent of each 
other Lender's pro rata share of such payment, to be a purchase 
by each such other Lender and a sale by BABC (without 
representation, warranty or recourse) of a participation in the 
Revolving Advances (applied first to the repurchase of a 
participation in Non-Ratable Advances) held by BABC immediately 
prior to the receipt and application of such payment.

(iv) If on any Settlement Date, (1) the pro rata share 
of any Lender in Non-Ratable Advances made since the next 
preceding Settlement Date is less than (2) such Lender's pro rata 
share of amounts received since the next preceding Settlement 
Date by the Administrative Agent and paid only to BABC and 
applied by BABC in accordance with clause (iii) above to the 
reduction of the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving 
Loan, such Lender and the Administrative Agent shall apply such 
difference to a decrease in such Lender's Revolving Advances, and 
BABC shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of 
such Lender an amount equal to such difference. If the amount in 
(1) and (2) are equal then no settlement shall be required.

(v) If on any Settlement Date, (1) the pro rata share of 
any Lender in Non-Ratable Advances made since the next preceding 
Settlement Date exceeds (2) such Lender's pro rata share of 
amounts received since the next preceding Settlement Date by the 
Administrative Agent and paid only to BABC and applied by BABC in 
accordance with clause (iii) above to the reduction of the 
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan, such Lender 
and the Administrative Agent shall apply such excess to an 
increase in such Lender's Revolving Advances, and such Lender 
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of BABC an 
amount equal to such excess.

(vi) If any amounts received by BABC in respect of the 
Lender Debt are later required to be returned or repaid by BABC 
to any Borrower or any other obligor or their respective 
representatives or successors in interest, whether by court 
order, settlement or otherwise, and such amounts repaid or 
returned by BABC are in excess of BABC's pro rata share of all 
such amounts required by virtue of the making of the Non-Ratable 
Advances to be returned by all Lenders, each other Lender shall, 
upon demand by BABC with notice to the Administrative Agent, pay 
to the Administrative Agent for the account of BABC, an amount 
equal to the excess of such Lender's pro rata share of all such 
amounts required to be returned by all Lenders over the amount, 
if any, returned directly by such Lender. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(vii) Payment under this Section 2.4(e) by any Lender 
(including, without limitation, BABC) to the Administrative Agent 
shall be made not later than 4:00 p.m. (New York time) on the 
Business Day such payment is due, provided that if such payment 
is due on written demand by another Lender, including pursuant to 
clause (f) below, such written demand shall be made on the paying 
Lender not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on such Business 
Day. Payment by the Administrative Agent to any Lender shall be 
made by wire transfer, promptly following the Administrative 
Agent's receipt of funds for the account of such Lender and in 
the type of funds received by the Administrative Agent, and the 
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the other Lenders of 
any such payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Administrative 
Agent receives such funds at or prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York 
time), the Administrative Agent shall pay such funds to such 
Lender on such Business Day. If a demand for payment is made 
after the applicable time set forth above, the payment due shall 
be made by on the first Business Day following the date of such 
demand.

(viii) As to each Settlement Period, BABC, on the one 
hand, and each Lender, on the other hand, shall be entitled to 
interest at the rate payable under this Agreement and the Notes, 
on the actual amount of funds employed by BABC and the other 
Lenders, respectively, during such Settlement Period and the 
Administrative Agent in applying payments received from any 
Credit Party or any Collateral to interest on the Revolving Loan 
shall treat the owner of a participation deemed purchased under 
Section 2.4(e)(iii) as though such owner were a direct Lender as 
to such participation and remit such payments received directly 
to such owner in respect of such participation. In the event 
that there shall be as of the end of any Settlement Period no 
source of payment for accrued interest owing to the purchaser of 
any outstanding participation under Section 2.4(e)(iii) hereof 
(in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent) or an 
Event of Default of the type described in Section 11.1(f) (other 
than clause (i) thereof) or 11.1(g) hereof, then interest accrued 
on such participation at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for 
such Settlement Period shall be paid, on demand, by the seller of 
such participation to the purchaser thereof, and without 
prejudice to any other claim which such seller may have, such 
seller shall be entitled to claim such interest from the Credit 
Parties. 

(f) The Administrative Agent or BABC shall by Written 
Notice to each Lender have the right at any time to suspend the 
provisions of Section 2.4(e) of this Agreement. From and after the 
giving of such Written Notice (and until such time, if any, as the 
Administrative Agent notifies the Lenders of its determination to 
return to a periodic settlement basis in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 2.4(e) hereof) and the settlement occurring at 
the end of the Settlement Period, if any, during which such Written 
Notice was given, the provisions of Section 2.4(e) hereof shall be of 
no force and effect. In addition to, and without limiting the right 
of the Administrative Agent to suspend the periodic settlement 
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, upon written demand by BABC with

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Written Notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, each other Lender 
shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of BABC, such 
amount as may be necessary for such other Lender to repurchase from 
BABC, at par, any outstanding participation interest previously 
purchased by BABC under Section 2.4(e)(iii) hereof. Payments made 
pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be made not later than 4:00 
p.m. (New York time) on any Business Day if demand for such payment 
is received by such Lender not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) 
on such Business Day; otherwise, any such payment shall be made on 
the next Business Day after demand is received therefor. 

2.5. TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT 
FACILITY COMMITMENT. (a) The Revolving Credit Facility Commitment 
shall terminate on the Maturity Date. Upon termination of the 
Revolving Credit Facility Commitment for any reason, the Revolving 
Loan (together with all other Lender Debt) shall become automatically 
immediately due and payable together with all accrued interest 
thereon to such date plus any fees, premiums, charges or costs 
provided for hereunder, together with the cancellation or termination 
of any outstanding Letters of Credit (or the provision of Letter of 
Credit Cash Collateral equal to the undrawn amount under all 
outstanding Letters of Credit) and the reimbursement of any 
unreimbursed Letters of Credit.

(b) The Borrowers shall have the right, upon not less than 
five (5) Business Days' prior Written Notice to the Administrative 
Agent (which shall promptly notify each Lender thereof in writing or 
by telephone confirmed promptly in writing), to reduce (in whole or 
in part) the Tranche A Commitment Amount, in which case the Tranche A 
Commitment Amount and the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment shall 
be permanently reduced by the amount of such reduction; PROVIDED, 
HOWEVER, that any such reduction shall be accompanied by (i) 
prepayment of any amount required to be prepaid pursuant to Section 
4.1(b) hereof as a result of such reduction, (ii) payment of any 
unpaid fees owing with respect to that portion of the Revolving 
Credit Facility Commitment that is reduced, (iii) payment of all 
other fees, premiums, costs, and charges required to be paid by the 
Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 4.8 hereof and (iv) 
payment of all accrued interest on any amount that the Borrowers are 
required to prepay pursuant to Section 4.1(b) hereof as a result of 
such reduction.

(c) Following receipt by one or more Credit Parties of at 
least $30,000,000 as the gross cash proceeds from the issuance of 
Acceptable Subordinated Debt or Acceptable Equity, and so long as the 
Borrowers are in compliance with each of the financial covenants set 
forth in 9.16 hereof, the Borrowers shall have the right, upon not 
less than five (5) Business Days' prior Written Notice to the 
Administrative Agent (which shall notify each Lender thereof in 
writing or by telephone confirmed promptly in writing), to reduce (in 
whole or in part) the Tranche B Commitment Amount, in which case the 
Tranche B Commitment Amount and the Revolving Credit Facility 
Commitment shall be permanently reduced by the amount of such 
reduction, without premium or penalty, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any 
such reduction shall be accompanied by (x) prepayment of any amount 
required to be prepaid pursuant to Section 4.1(b) hereof as a result

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
of such reduction, (y) payment of any unpaid fees owing with respect 
to that portion of the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment that is 
reduced and (z) payment of all accrued interest on any amount that 
the Borrowers are required to pay pursuant to Section 4.1(b) hereof 
as a result of such reduction.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
herein, in no event shall the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment at 
any time be reduced to an amount that is less than the aggregate 
amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations then outstanding.

2.6. INTEREST. (a) INTEREST ON EURODOLLAR ADVANCES. 
Except as provided in Sections 2.6(c) hereof, the Borrowers shall pay 
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Advance 
which is outstanding from time to time, on each Interest Payment Date 
with respect to such Eurodollar Advance, at the date of conversion of 
such Eurodollar Advance (or portion thereof) to a Reference Rate 
Advance and at maturity of such Eurodollar Advance at an interest 
rate per annum during the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Advance 
equal to the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period in effect for 
such Eurodollar Advance plus the Applicable Margin, and after 
maturity of such Eurodollar Advance (whether by acceleration or 
otherwise) upon demand. 

(b) INTEREST ON REFERENCE RATE ADVANCES. Except as 
provided in Sections 2.6(c) hereof, the Borrowers shall pay interest 
on the unpaid principal amount of each Reference Rate Advance and, to 
the extent due and payable, Additional Indebtedness incurred by it, 
in each case, which is outstanding from time to time at an interest 
rate per annum equal to the Reference Rate in effect from time to 
time plus the Applicable Margin. Interest on all Reference Rate 
Advances shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each 
month commencing with the first day of the first month commencing 
after the month in which the Closing Date occurs, and at maturity 
(whether by acceleration or otherwise) and thereafter on demand. 
Interest on Additional Indebtedness shall be payable upon demand.

(c) DEFAULT INTEREST. During the continuation of any Event 
of Default, interest on Eurodollar Advances and Reference Rate 
Advances, shall accrue and be payable at a rate two percentage points 
(2%) in excess of the rate of interest otherwise applicable to 
Eurodollar Advances or Reference Rate Advances, as the case may be, 
and interest on any interest in default shall accrue and shall be 
payable upon demand at a rate equal to two percentage points (2%) in 
excess of the rate then applicable to the Advance on which such 
interest accrued, or in the case of interest accrued on Additional 
Indebtedness, at a rate of four percentage points (4%) in excess of 
the Reference Rate.

(d) EURODOLLAR RATE DETERMINATION. The Administrative 
Agent, upon determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period, 
shall promptly notify by telephone (confirmed promptly in writing) or 
in writing the applicable Borrower and the Lenders thereof. Such 
determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive 
and binding upon the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(e) STEP-DOWN/STEP-UP PRICING ADJUSTMENTS. In the event 
that the financial statements for any Fiscal Year delivered pursuant 
to Section 9.1(b) hereof demonstrate compliance as of the date of 
such financial statements with "Level 2", "Level 3", "Level 4" or 
"Level 5" of each of the financial tests set forth in Schedule 2.6(e) 
hereto, then the Applicable Margin with respect to Tranche A Advances 
and the fees payable to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 
4.7 hereof shall be adjusted to the applicable amounts set forth in 
said Schedule 2.6(e) (in each case subject to Section 2.6(c) hereof). 
Each such adjustment shall take effect (if at all) as of the latest 
date the applicable financial statements described in the immediately 
preceding sentence were required to be delivered under Section 9.1 
hereof and shall remain in effect until the latest date delivery of 
financial statements are required to be delivered pursuant to Section 
9.1(b) hereof that demonstrate either compliance with a higher 
"Level" of each of the financial tests set forth in said Schedule 
2.6(e) or the failure to maintain compliance with the "Level" of each 
such test achieved as of the end of the immediately prior Fiscal 
Year, whereupon (subject to Section 2.6(c) hereof) such amounts shall 
be decreased or increased, as the case may be, to the applicable 
amounts set forth in said Schedule 2.6(e).

2.7. CONVERSION OF BORROWINGS; RENEWALS. (a) Each 
Borrower may, from time to time prior to the Maturity Date convert 
(i) all or a portion of its outstanding Reference Rate Advances which 
are Tranche A Advances to one or more Eurodollar Advances, except as 
provided in the last sentence of Section 2.4(a) or in Section 2.4(b), 
2.10 or 2.11 hereof, and only in aggregate amounts of $10,000,000 or 
any greater integral multiple of $1,000,000 or (ii) all or a portion 
of outstanding Eurodollar Advances to one or more Reference Rate 
Advances so long as the aggregate principal balance of the portion of 
the Eurodollar Advances not being converted, if any, is $10,000,000 
or any greater integral multiple of $1,000,000. Interest on any 
Reference Rate Advance which is accrued and unpaid as of the time of 
such conversion shall be paid on the next date interest becomes due 
and payable under Section 2.6(b) hereof. Each conversion by a 
Borrower of any Advance or portion thereof (other than a conversion 
pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.11 hereof) shall be made not later than 
12:00 noon (New York time) on a Business Day on at least three (3) 
Business Days' prior Written Notice from an Authorized Representative 
to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall 
promptly notify each Lender thereof in writing or by telephone 
confirmed promptly in writing) from such Borrower. Each such notice 
(which notice shall be irrevocable and shall conclusively evidence 
the joint and several obligation of the Borrowers to repay such 
Revolving Advance) shall specify (i) the date of the conversion and 
the amount to be converted, (ii) the particular Reference Rate 
Advance which is a Tranche A Advance, or portion thereof, to be 
converted, and (iii) in the case of conversion of any Reference Rate 
Advance which is a Tranche A Advance, or portion thereof, to a 
Eurodollar Advance, the duration of the Interest Period for such 
Eurodollar Advance. Notwithstanding the above, no Borrower shall be 
entitled to convert any Reference Rate Advance, or portion thereof, 
to a Eurodollar Advance to the extent such Borrower is prohibited by 
Section 2.4(b) from requesting conversion thereof. Except as 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
provided in Section 2.10 hereof, any conversion of a Eurodollar 
Advance, or portion thereof, to a Reference Rate Advance shall be 
made only on the last day of the Interest Period with respect to such 
Eurodollar Advance.

(b) Each renewal by a Borrower of an outstanding Eurodollar 
Advance or portion thereof shall be made on Written Notice to the 
Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly 
notify each Lender thereof in writing or by telephone confirmed 
promptly in writing) given not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) 
on the third Business Day prior to the last day of the Interest 
Period just ending for such Eurodollar Advance. Each notice (which 
notice shall be irrevocable and shall conclusively evidence the joint 
and several obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Revolving 
Advance) by a Borrower of the renewal of a Eurodollar Advance or 
portion thereof, shall be in writing from an Authorized 
Representative and shall specify (i) the amount of such renewal of 
the Eurodollar Advance or portion thereof and (ii) the duration of 
the Interest Period for such renewal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such 
Borrower fails to select the duration of any Interest Period for the 
renewal of such Eurodollar Advance or portion thereof, the duration 
of such Interest Period shall be one month. Notwithstanding the 
above, no Borrower shall be entitled to renew a Eurodollar Advance or 
a portion thereof, (i) if at the time of the selection of such 
renewal there shall exist a Default, or (ii) to the extent such 
renewal would be prohibited by the last sentence of Section 2.4(a) 
hereof, by clause (z) of Section 2.4(b) hereof or by Section 2.10 or 
2.11 hereof.

(c) Any Eurodollar Advance or portion thereof as to which 
the Administrative Agent shall not have received a proper notice of 
conversion or renewal as provided in Section 2.7(a) or 2.7(b) hereof 
or notice of payment or prepayment by 12:00 noon (New York time) at 
least three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of the Interest 
Period just ending for such Eurodollar Advance shall (whether or not 
any Default or Event of Default has occurred) automatically be 
converted to a Reference Rate Advance on the last day of the Interest 
Period for such Eurodollar Advance.

2.8. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. All interest payable 
hereunder and all fees and other amounts calculated on the basis of a 
rate per annum shall be computed on the basis of actual days elapsed 
over a 360-day year. Any rate of interest on Reference Rate 
Advances, Additional Indebtedness, or interest which is computed on 
the basis of the Reference Rate shall change when and as the 
Reference Rate changes.

2.9. INCREASED COSTS. In the case of the pro rata share 
of any Lender in any Eurodollar Advance, in the event any law, 
treaty, order, directive, rule or regulations shall be adopted, 
issued or becoming effective after the Closing Date or in the event 
of any change in any law, treaty, order, directive, role or 
regulation (including, without limitation, in any case Regulation D) 
from that in effect on the Closing Date or in the interpretation 
thereof by any governmental or other regulatory authority charged 
with the administration thereof (in any case, whether or not having 
the force of law), in any case, which:

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(i) subjects such Lender or any branch or Affiliate of 
such Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to such 
share of such Eurodollar Advance (other than Excluded Taxes); or

(ii) changes the basis of taxation (including without 
limitation an increase in any applicable tax rate) of payments to 
any Lender or any branch or Affiliate of such Lender of principal 
of and/or interest on such share of such Eurodollar Advance 
and/or other fees and amounts payable hereunder with respect 
thereto (other than Excluded Taxes); or

(iii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, 
deposit, special deposit, insurance assessment or similar 
requirement against any assets held by, deposits with or for the 
account of, or loans by, an office of any Lender or any branch or 
Affiliate of such Lender; or

(iv) imposes upon such Lender or any branch or 
affiliate of such Lender any other condition with respect to such 
share of such Eurodollar Advance or this Agreement (excluding any 
event referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.12(b) 
hereof).

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the actual cost 
by an amount such Lender deems to be material to such Lender or any 
branch or Affiliate of such Lender of making, funding or maintaining 
such share of such Eurodollar Advance hereunder, or to reduce the 
amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest, or otherwise) 
received or receivable by such Lender or any branch or Affiliate of 
such Lender, or to require such Lender or any branch or Affiliate of 
such Lender to make any payment, in each case by or in an amount 
which such Lender in its reasonable judgment deems material and, in 
any case, is not compensated for by the Eurodollar Reserve 
Percentage, then and in any such case:

(1) such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers, 
the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders in writing of the 
happening of such event;

(2) such Lender shall promptly deliver to the 
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders a 
certificate stating the change which has occurred, or the reserve 
requirements or other conditions which have been imposed on such 
Lender or branch or Affiliate of such Lender, or the request, 
directive or requirement with which it has complied, together 
with the date thereof, the amount of such increased cost, 
reduction or payment and the way in which such amount has been 
calculated; and

(3) the Borrowers hereby agree to pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Lender on demand by 
such Lender (with a notice of such demand to be sent by such 
Lender to the Administrative Agent) such an amount or amounts as 
will compensate such Lender or its branch or Affiliate for such 
additional cost, reduction or payment.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
The certificate of such Lender as to the additional amounts payable 
pursuant to this Section 2.9 delivered to the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent shall in the absence of manifest error be 
conclusive of the amount thereof. The protection of this Section 2.9 
shall be available to such Lender regardless of any possible 
contention of invalidity or inapplicability of the law, regulation, 
treaty, order, directive, interpretation or condition which has been 
imposed.

2.10. CHANGE IN LAW RENDERING EURODOLLAR ADVANCES 
UNLAWFUL. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein 
contained, in the event that any law, treaty, order, directive, rule 
or regulation adopted, issued or becoming effective after the Closing 
Date or any change in any law, treaty, order, directive, rule or 
regulation from that in effect on the Closing Date or in the 
interpretation thereof by any governmental or other regulatory 
authority charged with the administration thereof (in any case, 
whether or not having the force of law), should make it unlawful for 
any Lender to fund any portion of a Eurodollar Advance or to give 
effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to 
Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall, upon the happening of such 
event, notify the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the 
Borrowers thereof in writing stating the reason therefor, and the 
obligation of such Lender to allow conversion to or selection or 
renewal with respect to its pro rata share of any Eurodollar Advance 
by any Borrower shall, upon the happening of such event, forthwith be 
suspended for the duration of such illegality and during such 
illegality such Lender shall fund its share of all Revolving Advances 
as Reference Rate Advances and there shall be no renewal of, or 
conversion to, any share of such Lender in any Eurodollar Advance. 
If and when such illegality ceases to exist, such suspension shall 
cease and such affected Lender shall similarly notify the 
Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the Borrowers.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
herein, in the event that any treaty, order, directive, rule or 
regulation adopted, issued or becoming effective after the Closing 
Date or any change in any law, treaty, order, directive, rule or 
regulation from that in effect on the Closing Date or in the 
interpretation thereof by any governmental or other regulatory 
authority charged with the administration thereof (in any case, 
whether or not having the force of law) shall make it commercially 
impracticable or unlawful for any Lender to continue in effect the 
funding of any portion of a Eurodollar Advance previously made by it 
hereunder and then outstanding, such Lender shall, upon the happening 
of such event, notify the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and 
the Borrowers thereof in writing stating the reasons therefor, and 
such Lender's pro rata share of such Eurodollar Advance shall 
automatically be converted to a Reference Rate Advance. The 
Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of 
such Lender accrued interest owing on such converted portion of such 
Eurodollar Advance made to the applicable Borrower through the date 
of such conversion, together with any amounts payable under Section 
2.12 hereof with respect to such prepayment. After such notice shall

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
have been given and until the circumstances giving rise to such 
notice no longer exist, each request for such Lender's pro rata share 
of a Eurodollar Advance or for conversion to or renewal of such 
Lender's pro rata share of a Eurodollar Advance shall be deemed a 
request by the applicable Borrower for a Reference Rate Advance. If 
and when such impracticability or illegality ceases to exist, such 
suspension shall cease and such affected Lender shall similarly 
notify the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the Borrowers.

2.11. EURODOLLAR AVAILABILITY. (a) In the event, and on 
each occasion, that on the day two (2) Business Days prior to the 
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Advance, the 
Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (which 
determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive 
and binding upon the Borrowers) that dollar deposits in the amount of 
the principal amount of such Eurodollar Advance are not generally 
available in the London (England) interbank market, or that the rate 
at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not accurately 
reflect the cost to one or more Lenders of making or funding the 
principal amount of their portions of such Eurodollar Advance during 
such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not exist for 
ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as 
soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telephonic notice of 
such determination to the Lenders and the Borrowers, and any request 
by a Borrower for a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof 
or for conversion to or renewal of a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to 
Section 2.7 hereof shall thereupon, and until the circumstances 
giving rise to such notice no longer exist (as notified by the 
Administrative Agent to the Borrowers and the Lenders), be deemed a 
request by any Borrower for the making of or conversion to a 
Reference Rate Advance.

(b) If, at any time, the Administrative Agent shall have 
determined (which determination shall, in the absence of manifest 
error, be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that any 
contingency has occurred which adversely affects the London (England) 
interbank market or that any law, treaty, order, directive, rule or 
regulation that is adopted, or issued or that becomes effective after 
the Closing Date or any change in any existing law, treaty, order, 
directive, rule or regulation from that in effect on the Closing Date 
or in the interpretation thereof (in any case, whether or not having 
the force of law) or other circumstance affecting one or more Lenders 
or the London (England) interbank market makes the funding of any 
portion of a Eurodollar Advance impracticable, the Administrative 
Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or 
telephonic notice of such determination to the Lenders and the 
Borrowers and any request by a Borrower for a Eurodollar Advance 
pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof or for conversion to or renewal of a 
Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof shall thereupon, 
and until the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer 
exist (as notified by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers and 
the Lenders), be deemed a request by any Borrower for the making of 
or conversion to a Reference Rate Advance.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
2.12 INDEMNITIES. (a) Each Borrower hereby indemnifies 
each Lender on demand against any loss or expense which such Lender 
or its branch or affiliate may sustain or incur as a consequence of:

(i) to the extent such loss or expense is not compensated 
by the accrual of interest under Section 2.6(d) hereof or the 
conversion of any Eurodollar Advance to a Reference Rate Advance, 
any default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of 
any Eurodollar Advance made to it or any portion of any thereof 
or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the 
due date thereof, by irrevocable notice of payment or prepayment, 
or otherwise),

(ii) the effect of the occurrence of any Event of Default 
upon any Eurodollar Advance made to it, including, but not 
limited to, any loss or expense sustained or incurred in 
liquidating or employing deposits from third parties acquired to 
effect or maintain such Eurodollar Advance or any portion 
thereof,

(iii) the payment or prepayment of the principal amount of 
any Eurodollar Advance made to it or any portion of any thereof, 
pursuant to Section 2 or 4 hereof, or otherwise, on any day other 
than the Maturity Date or (except in the case of payments of 
interest on an Interest Payment Date) the last day of an Interest 
Period (in the case of any Eurodollar Advance), or the payment of 
any interest on any Eurodollar Advance made to it, or portion 
thereof, on a day other than an Interest Payment Date for such 
Eurodollar Advance, or

(iv) the failure by any Borrower to accept or make a 
borrowing of a Eurodollar Advance or a conversion to or renewal 
of a Eurodollar Advance after it has given notice of such 
borrowing, conversion or renewal.

Each Lender shall provide to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent 
and the other Lenders a statement, supported where applicable by 
documentary evidence, explaining the amount and calculation of any 
such loss or expense it incurs, which statement shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error.

(b) If any law, treaty, order, directive, rule or 
regulation shall be adopted, issued or become effective after the 
Closing Date or if any change in any law, treaty, order, directive, 
role or regulation from that in effect on the Closing Date or in the 
interpretation thereof by any governmental or other regulatory 
authority charged with the administration thereof (in any case, 
whether or not having the force of law), and including, without 
limitation, all risk based capital guidelines heretofore adopted by 
the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board or any other banking 
regulatory agency, domestic or foreign, to the extent that any 
provision contained therein does not have to be complied with as of 
the date hereof, shall, or if the compliance by any Lender with any 
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental 
authority, shall:

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(i) impose upon, modify, require, make or deem applicable 
to any one or more Lenders, or any of their Affiliates or 
branches, any reserve requirement, special deposit requirement, 
insurance assessment or similar requirement against or affecting 
the Revolving Commitment of such Lender or Lenders or such 
Affiliates or branches, or

(ii) impose any condition upon or cause in any manner 
the addition of, any supplement to or any increase of any kind to 
the capital or cost base of such Lender or Lenders, or such 
Affiliates or branches thereof, for extending or maintaining the 
Revolving Commitment of such Lender, which results in an increase 
in the capital requirement supporting the Revolving Commitment, 
or 

(iii) impose upon, modify, require, make or deem 
applicable to such Lender or Lenders or any such Affiliates or 
branches any capital requirement, increased capital requirement 
or similar requirement, 

and the result of any events referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) 
above shall be to (A) increase the amount of capital required or 
expected to be required to be maintained by such Lender or any such 
Affiliate or branch and such Lender determines that the amount of 
such capital requirement is incurred by or based on the Revolving 
Commitment of such Lender or other commitments of this type or (B) 
increase the costs or decrease the benefit in any way to such Lender 
or Lenders, or any such Affiliate or branch, of extending or 
maintaining the Revolving Commitment or extending or maintaining such 
Lender's or Lenders' portion of the Loans or holding any Collateral; 

THEN and in such event the Borrowers shall, on or prior to the tenth 
(10th) Business Day after the giving of Written Notice of such 
increased costs and/or decreased benefits to the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent by such Lender or Lenders (or any such Affiliate 
or branch), pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of such 
Lender or Lenders all such additional amounts which in the sole good 
faith calculation of such Lender or Lenders are properly allocable to 
the Revolving Commitment of such Lender, such Lender's or Lenders' 
portion of the Loans and/or the Collateral, as the case may be, and 
which:

(1) in the case of events referred to in clause (i) 
above, shall be sufficient to compensate it for all such 
increased costs and/or decreased benefits, and/or

(2) in the case of events referred to in clauses (ii) 
and (iii) above, shall be an amount equal to the reduction, as 
reasonably determined by such Lender, in the after-tax rate of 
return on such Lender's capital resulting from any such capital 
or increased capital or similar requirement (including, without 
limitation, any such Lender's or Lender's Affiliates' or 
branches' cost of taking action in anticipation of the

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
efectiveness of any event described in clause (ii) or (iii) in 
order to enable such Lender, Lenders, Affiliate or branch to be 
in compliance therewith upon such effectiveness), all as 
certified by such Lender or Lenders in said Written Notice to the 
Borrowers. Such certification shall be conclusive and binding on 
the Borrowers absent manifest error.

(c) Each Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds harmless 
each of the Agents and each Lender and each Agent's and each Lender's 
Affiliates, and each of such Agent's, Lender's and Affiliate's 
directors, officers, agents, representatives, counsel and employees 
and each other Person, if any, controlling them or any of their 
Affiliates within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended, or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (each an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any and 
all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable 
counsel fees and disbursements and the allocated costs and expenses 
of in-house counsel) and liabilities which may be incurred by or 
asserted against such Indemnified Party with respect to or arising 
out of the financing contemplated by this Agreement, the commitments 
hereunder to make, or the making of Revolving Advances or the 
financing contemplated hereby, the other Loan Documents, the 
Collateral (including, without limitation, the use of the financing 
by any Credit Party, the exercise by any of the Agents or any Lender 
of rights and remedies or any power of attorney with respect thereto, 
and any action or inaction of any of the Agents or any Lender under 
any Security Document), the use of proceeds of any financial 
accommodations provided hereunder, or any investigation, litigation 
or other proceeding brought or threatened relating to the financing 
provided hereunder, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or 
otherwise in connection herewith or the role of any Person or Persons 
in connection with the foregoing, whether or not they or any other 
Indemnified Party is named as a party to any legal action or 
proceeding ("Claims"). No Borrower will, however, be responsible to 
any Indemnified Party hereunder for any Claims to the extent that any 
such Claim shall have arisen out of or resulted from actions taken or 
omitted to be taken by such Indemnified Party which constitute the 
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party as 
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction 
("Excluded Claims"). Further, should any of the Agents' or any of 
the Lender's employees be involved in any legal action or proceeding 
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (other than 
relating to an Excluded Claim), the Borrowers hereby agree to pay to 
such Agent and such Lender an amount equal to the actual per diem 
compensation for each employee for each day or portion thereof that 
such employee is involved in preparing for or giving testimony 
(including, without limitation, deposition testimony) pertaining to 
any such legal action or proceeding. The Indemnified Party shall 
give the Borrowers prompt Written Notice of any Claim setting forth a 
description of those elements of the Claim of which such Indemnified 
Party has knowledge. As to any Claim, the Indemnified Party shall 
have the right to select counsel and control the defense of such 
Claims; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that so long as no Specified Event of 
Default is continuing no Indemnified Party shall settle any Claim as

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
to which it is controlling the defense without the consent of the 
Borrowers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed. The Indemnified Parties and the Borrowers and their 
respective counsel shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable 
respects in any investigation, trial and defense of any such Claim 
and any appeal arising therefrom.

(d) If for any reason the foregoing indemnity is 
unavailable to any Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold it free 
and harmless as contemplated by the preceding paragraph (c), then the 
Borrowers shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the 
Indemnified Party as a result of any Claim in such proportion as is 
appropriate to reflect, not only the relative benefits received by 
the Borrowers on the one hand and such Indemnified Party on the other 
hand, but also the relative fault of the Borrowers and such 
Indemnified Party, as well as any other relevant equitable 
considerations.

2.13 DISBURSEMENT. Each Advance to any Borrower shall be 
disbursed by the Administrative Agent from the Payment Account 
provided in Section 2.4(c) hereof (or such other account as the 
Administrative Agent shall from time to time elect) to the 
Disbursement Account of such Borrower (or such other account as such 
Borrower may, with the prior consent of the Administrative Agent, 
designate), shall be charged, together with interest, fees and other 
amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder, to the account of the 
Borrowers on the books of the Administrative Agent from time to time, 
and shall be payable to the Payment Account or to such other account 
or office as the Administrative Agent may specify in writing to the 
Borrowers.

2.14. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S AVAILABILITY ASSUMPTION. 
During any period after the Closing Date when the settlement 
procedures under Section 2.4(e) hereof are not in effect: 

(a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been 
notified by any Lender by Written Notice prior to a borrowing date 
that such Lender does not intend to make available to the 
Administrative Agent such Lender's pro rata portion of any Advance to 
any Borrower which it shall be obligated to make on such date, the 
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made or will 
make such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date 
for such borrowing and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon 
such assumption, make available to such Borrower a corresponding 
amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available 
to the Administrative Agent by such Lender on such date of borrowing, 
the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such 
corresponding amount on demand from such Lender, which demand shall 
be made in a reasonably prompt manner. If such Lender does not pay 
such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's 
demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the 
Lenders and the Borrowers and the Borrowers shall pay such 
corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent on demand.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(b) The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to 
recover from such Lender or the Borrowers interest on such 
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such 
corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent 
to the applicable Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is 
recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to 
(x) if paid by such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (y) 
if paid by one or more of the Borrowers, the applicable rate for 
Reference Rate Advances or Eurodollar Advances, as the case may be. 

(c) In the event that any Lender shall fail to fund its pro 
rata share of any Revolving Advance made pursuant to Section 3.4 
hereof or its letter of credit participation under Section 3.5 
hereof, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the applicable Issuing 
Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such 
Lender, which demand shall be made in a reasonably prompt manner. If 
such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the 
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent 
shall notify promptly the Lenders and the Borrowers thereof and the 
Borrowers shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent. The 
Administrative Agent on behalf of the applicable Issuing Lender shall 
also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrowers, as the 
case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each 
day from the date such Revolving Advance was made, or the date such 
purchase was to have been made or funded, to the date such amount is 
recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to 
(x) if paid by such Lender, the cost (based on the Federal Funds 
Effective Rate) to the applicable Issuing Lender of funding the 
payment of the drawing under the Letter of Credit for which the 
Revolving Advance was made in the case of a Revolving Advance made 
pursuant to Section 3.4 or a participation under Section 3.5 hereof, 
or (y) if paid by one or more of the Borrowers, the applicable rate 
for Reference Rate Advances in the case of a Revolving Advance made 
pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof or a participation purchased under 
Section 3.5 hereof.

(d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender 
from its obligation to fund or purchase its pro rata share of any 
Advance or purchase any participation as required hereunder, or to 
prejudice any rights which any Borrower may have against any Lender 
as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. No Lender shall 
be responsible for any default of any other Lender in respect of any 
other Lender's obligation to make its pro rata share of any Advances 
hereunder nor shall the Revolving Commitment of any Lender hereunder 
be increased as a result of such default of any other Lender. Each 
Lender shall be obligated to the extent provided herein regardless of 
the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder.

2.15. PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS. Except as 
contemplated by Sections 2.4(e), 2.9, 2.10, 2.12, 2.14, 2.18, 4.6, 
13.1, 13.5, 13.6, 13.13(h), 13.14(g) and 13.15(e) hereof, each 
Advance and each payment (including each prepayment) on account of 
the principal of and interest on the Revolving Loan and fees 
described in this Agreement shall be made pro rata to each Lender

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
according to the respective percentages of each Lender set forth 
opposite its name on Exhibit A hereto. The Administrative Agent 
will, subject to Section 2.4(e) hereof, distribute each payment to 
the Lenders in accordance with Section 2.19 hereof.

2.16. EURODOLLAR OFFICES. Each Lender may initially 
fulfill its commitment with respect to such Lender's pro rata share 
of any Eurodollar Advance by causing the Initial Eurodollar Office of 
such Lender to make such Lender's proportionate share of such 
Eurodollar Advance or in any other manner or from any other source; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Lender may at its option fulfill such 
commitment by causing another branch or an Affiliate of such Lender 
to make such Lender's pro rata share of such Eurodollar Advance; and 
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the selection by such Lender of the Initial 
Eurodollar Office of such Lender or any other such branch or 
Affiliate shall not affect the obligations of the Borrowers to repay 
such Lender's pro rata share of the Eurodollar Advances in accordance 
with the terms of this Agreement.

2.17. TELEPHONIC NOTICE. Without in any way limiting the 
obligation of each Borrower to confirm in writing any telephonic 
notice by such Borrower of a borrowing, conversion or renewal, the 
Administrative Agent may act without liability upon the basis of 
telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith 
to be from an Authorized Representative of such Borrower prior to 
receipt of written confirmation.

2.18. MAXIMUM INTEREST. (a) No provision of this 
Agreement or any Note shall require the payment to any Lender or 
permit the collection by any Lender of interest in excess of the 
maximum rate permitted by any applicable law (the "Maximum Lawful 
Rate").

(b) If the amount of interest computed without giving 
effect to this Section 2.18 and payable on any interest payment date 
in respect of the preceding interest computation period would exceed 
the amount of interest computed in respect of such period at the 
maximum rate of interest from time to time permitted (after taking 
into account all consideration which constitute interest) by laws 
applicable to any Lender (such maximum rate being such Lender's 
"Maximum Permissible Rate"), the amount of interest payable to such 
Lender on such date in respect of such period shall be computed at 
such Lender's Maximum Permissible Rate.

(c) If at any time and from time to time (i) the amount of 
interest payable to any Lender on any interest payment date shall be 
computed at such Lender's Maximum Permissible Rate pursuant to the 
preceding paragraph (b) and (ii) in respect of any subsequent 
interest computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable 
to such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to 
such Lender computed at such Lender's Maximum Permissible Rate, then 
the amount of interest payable to such Lender in respect of such 
subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed 
at such Lender's Maximum Permissible Rate until the amount of

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
interest payable to such Lender shall equal the total amount of 
interest which would have been payable to such Lender if the total 
amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to the 
preceding paragraph (b).

2.19 RECEIPT OF PAYMENTS. (a) The Borrowers shall make 
each payment under this Agreement without deduction, set-off, defense 
(other than the defense of payment), recoupment, claim or 
counterclaim, all of which are waived but may be used in an 
independent proceeding, not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on 
the day when due in lawful money of the United States of America in 
immediately available funds to the Payment Account. Subject to 
Section 2.4(e) hereof, the Administrative Agent will, upon any such 
payment to the Payment Account, promptly thereafter (and in any event 
on the same Business Day as the date when received if such payment is 
received at or prior to 12:00 noon (New York time), cause to be 
distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or 
interest ratably to the Lenders or as otherwise provided above, and 
like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any 
Lender to such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with 
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Pursuant and subject to Section 9.20 hereof, each 
Borrower has agreed (i) to cause all of such Borrower's Proceeds to 
be deposited into one or more of its Collection Accounts, and to 
cause all such Proceeds to be transferred to such Borrower's 
Concentration Account, and (ii) to cause all Proceeds in such 
Borrower's Concentration Account to be transferred to the Payment 
Account in accordance with the applicable Concentration Account 
Agreement. Subject to Section 2.20(a) hereof, on each Business Day, 
the Administrative Agent shall apply to the Lender Debt (or invest as 
hereinafter provided) effective as of such Business Day, all Proceeds 
credited in immediately available funds to the Payment Account on 
such Business Day (and which shall not have theretofore been credited 
to the Lender Debt) as follows: (i) first, to the Revolving Loan, as 
a prepayment thereof until the amount so applied shall equal the then 
unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Loan and (ii) second, 
invested in accordance with and subject to the requirements of 
Section 2.20(b) hereof. 

In the event any Borrower (or any Affiliate of any Borrower 
or any Person acting for or in concert with any Borrower) shall 
receive any monies, checks, drafts or other similar negotiable items 
of payment made with respect to Accounts, such Borrower shall no 
later than the Business Day following receipt thereof deposit or 
cause the same to be deposited, in kind, in a Collection Account or 
as otherwise directed by the Administrative Agent.

2.20. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. (a) During the 
continuance of any Event of Default, each Borrower irrevocably (x) 
waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments or 
Proceeds or Letter of Credit Cash Collateral received or held at any 
time or times during such period by the Administrative Agent or any 
Lender from or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant to the terms of

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
this Agreement, and (y) agrees that the Administrative Agent and 
Lenders shall have the continuing exclusive right to apply any and 
all such payments, Proceeds and Letter of Credit Cash Collateral 
against any Lender Debt of any Borrower as the Administrative Agent 
may deem advisable or as otherwise provided herein. Unless otherwise 
provided herein (including, without limitation, under the immediately 
preceding sentence or under Section 2.19(b) hereof or Section 11.5 
hereof) or in the absence of a specific determination by the 
Administrative Agent with respect thereto, any and all payments or 
Proceeds received at any time by the Administrative Agent, shall, 
when in the form of immediately available funds, be applied in the 
following manner and order: (i) payment of then due and payable fees 
and expenses owing under the Loan Documents; (ii) payment of then due 
and payable interest payments on the Lender Debt owing under the Loan 
Documents; (iii) payment of then due and payable principal payments 
on the Revolving Loan; (iv) prepayment of principal outstanding under 
the Revolving Loan until the amount so applied shall equal the then 
unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Loan; (v) provision of 
Letter of Credit Cash Collateral until the amount so applied shall 
equal the then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations not then 
secured by Letter of Credit Cash Collateral; and (vi) payment of 
other Lender Debt outstanding under the Loan Documents then due and 
payable. Any amounts remaining after application of all items in 
clauses (i) through (vi) above may, at the option of the 
Administrative Agent, be deposited in a deposit account of the 
Administrative Agent as provided in paragraph (b) below or be 
remitted to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent may apply any 
Letter of Credit Cash Collateral to Letter of Credit Obligations 
which have become due and payable and fees and other amounts due and 
owing in respect thereof.

(b) Subject to paragraph (a) above, all amounts remaining 
after application as provided in the second sentence of paragraph (a) 
above, may, at the option of the Administrative Agent, be deposited 
into a deposit account maintained by the Administrative Agent or be 
remitted to the Borrowers. So long as no Event of Default or Default 
shall be continuing the Borrowers may direct that the Administrative 
Agent release any and all amounts (and earnings thereon) from such 
deposit account. Any amounts on deposit in such deposit account may 
be, unless and until withdrawn by the Borrowers, applied by the 
Administrative Agent to the payment of Lender Debt under the Loan 
Documents as provided in paragraph (a) above. Any monies remaining 
in such deposit account shall be invested and reinvested (so long as 
in such deposit account) by and in the name of the Administrative 
Agent in investments of the type permitted under Section 10.4(b) 
hereof with the type and maturity of such investments to be mutually 
agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (until an 
Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, at which time the 
Administrative Agent shall have the sole right to choose such 
investments). All interest and other income on such investments 
shall be for the account and risk of the Borrowers. As collateral 
security for the Lender Debt, each Borrower hereby grants to the 
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Agents and the ratable 
benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in (x) all monies in such 
deposit account and all investments thereof, including, without 
limitation, any certificates or instruments evidencing such 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
investments, and all claims and choses in action in respect of the 
foregoing, (y) any interest or other payment made in respect of such 
investments and (z) any and all proceeds of any of the above and all 
claims and choses in action in respect of the foregoing (all of the 
foregoing constituting part of the Collateral). To the extent the 
Administrative Agent makes any such investments, each Borrower hereby 
authorizes the Administrative Agent to hold any certificate or 
instrument evidencing such investments. 

(c) Subject to the contrary instructions contained in a 
Direction Letter, the Administrative Agent is authorized by the 
Lenders and the Borrowers to, and at its option may, make advances 
for the account of the Borrowers for payment of all fees, expenses, 
charges, costs and interest incurred by the Borrowers hereunder. 
Such advances, to the extent not prohibited by a Direction Letter, 
shall be made when and as the Borrowers fail promptly to pay such 
fees, expenses, charges, costs and interest and, at the 
Administrative Agent's option to the extent not prohibited by law and 
within the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders, shall be deemed 
Revolving Advances made by the Lenders and shall be part of the 
Revolving Loan hereunder to the extent that such advances would not 
(if so deemed) require a prepayment or the provision of Letter of 
Credit Cash Collateral under Section 4.1(b) hereof.

2.21 ACCOUNTING. The Administrative Agent will provide a 
monthly accounting of transactions under the Revolving Loan to the 
Borrowers and each Lender. Each and every such accounting shall 
(absent manifest error) be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon 
the Borrowers in all respects as to all matters reflected therein, 
unless the Borrowers, within 30 days after the date any such 
accounting is rendered, shall notify the Administrative Agent in 
writing of any objection which the Borrowers may have to any such 
accounting, describing the basis for such objection with specificity. 
In that event, only those items expressly objected to in such notice 
shall be deemed to be disputed by the Borrowers. 

2.22 TAXES. (a) Subject to Sections 2.22 (b) and (c) 
hereof, each payment or prepayment hereunder and under the Notes 
shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and free and clear of, 
and without deduction for, any present or future withholding or other 
taxes, duties or charges and all liabilities with respect thereto, of 
any nature imposed on such payments or prepayments by or on behalf of 
any government or any political subdivision or agency thereof or 
therein, except for Excluded Taxes (all such taxes, levies, duties, 
imposts, deductions, charges and liabilities, except Excluded Taxes, 
being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any such Taxes are so 
levied or imposed on any payment or prepayment to any Lender or the 
Administrative Agent or paid by such Lender or the Administrative 
Agent, the Borrowers will make additional payments to the 
Administrative Agent in such amounts as may be necessary so that the 
net amount received by such Lender or the Administrative Agent after 
withholding or deduction for or on account of such Taxes, including 
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 
2.22(a) (other than Excluded Taxes), will be equal to the amount 
provided for herein or in such Lender's Notes. Whenever any Taxes 
are payable by the Borrowers with respect to any payments or

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
prepayments hereunder or under any of the Notes, the Borrowers shall 
furnish promptly to the Administrative Agent for the account of the 
applicable Lender official receipts (to the extent that the relevant 
governmental authority delivers such receipts) evidencing payment of 
any such Taxes so withheld or deducted. If the Borrowers fail to pay 
any such Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails 
to remit to the Administrative Agent for the account of the 
applicable Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, the 
required receipts evidencing payment of any such Taxes so withheld or 
deducted, the Borrowers shall indemnify the affected Lender or the 
Administrative Agent, as applicable, for any incremental Taxes and 
any incremental Excluded Taxes or interest or penalties that may 
become payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as 
applicable, as a result of any such failure.

(b) (i) Except as provided in Section 2.22(b)(ii) below, 
each Lender (which, for purposes of Section 2.22 of this 
Agreement, shall include any Affiliate of a Lender that makes any 
Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.16 of this Agreement) 
that is not a "United States person" (as such term is defined in 
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrowers 
and the Administrative Agent on or before the Closing Date (or, 
in the case of a Person that becomes a Lender after the Closing 
Date, promptly upon such assignment), two duly completed and 
signed copies of either (1) Form 1001 of the United States 
Internal Revenue Service entitling such Lender to a complete 
exemption from withholding on all amounts to be received by such 
Lender pursuant to this Agreement and/or the Notes or (2) Form 
4224 of the United States Internal Revenue Service relating to 
all amounts to be received by such Lender pursuant to this 
Agreement and/or the Notes. Each such Lender shall, from time to 
time after submitting either such form, submit to the Borrowers 
and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and 
signed copies of one or the other such forms (or such successor 
forms or other documents as shall be adopted from time to time by 
the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may be (1) 
reasonably requested in writing by the Borrowers or the 
Administrative Agent and (2) appropriate under then current 
United States law or regulations to avoid United States 
withholding taxes on payments in respect of any amounts to be 
received by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement and/or the 
Notes. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the 
Administrative Agent, each Lender that has not provided the forms 
or other documents, as provided above, on the basis of being a 
United States person shall submit to the Borrowers and the 
Administrative Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such 
a "United States person."

(ii) If any Lender which is not a "United States 
person" determines that it is unable to submit to the Borrowers 
or the Administrative Agent any form or certificate that such 
Lender is requested to submit pursuant to the preceding 
paragraph, or that it is required to withdraw or cancel any such 
form or certificate, or that any such form or certificate 
previously submitted has otherwise become ineffective or 
inaccurate, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers and 
the Administrative Agent of such fact.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(iii) Except as provided in Section 2.22(c) and 
Section 13.6 hereof, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay 
any additional amount in respect of Taxes to any Lender if and 
only to the extent that (A) such Lender is subject to such Taxes 
(in such case, only to the extent of the tax rate then in effect) 
on the date this Agreement is executed by such Lender (or in the 
case of a Person that became a Lender after the Closing Date by 
assignment, on the date of such assignment) or would be subject 
to such Taxes on such date if a payment hereunder or on the Notes 
had been received by it on such date; (B) such Lender becomes 
subject to such Taxes subsequent to the date referred to in 
clause (A) above as a result of a change in the circumstances of 
such Lender, other than a change in applicable law (including 
without limitation an increase in any applicable tax rate), 
including without limitation a change in the residence, place of 
incorporation or principal place of business of the Lender, a 
change in the branch or lending office of the Lender 
participating in the transactions set forth herein or as a result 
of the sale by the Lender of participating interests in such 
Lender's creditor position(s) hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that 
the Borrowers will be required to pay any additional amount in 
respect of Taxes to any Lender to the extent that after a change 
in the circumstances (as described above) of such Lender a 
subsequent change in any applicable law results in an additional 
amount that such Lender is subject to with respect to Taxes; or 
(C) such Taxes would not have been incurred but for the failure 
of such Lender to file with the appropriate tax authorities 
and/or provide to the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent any 
form or certificate that it was required so to do pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this Section and entitled so to do under 
applicable law.

(c) In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay any present or 
future stamp or documentary taxes, any intangibles tax or any other 
sales, excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies now or 
hereafter assessed that arise from and are attributable to the 
execution, delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, 
the Notes, the Mortgages or other Security Documents and any and all 
recording fees relating to any Loan Documents securing any Lender 
Debt (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(d) Each Borrower shall indemnify and pay to each Lender 
and each of the Agents the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes which 
the Borrowers are required to pay to any Lender or any Agent pursuant 
to this Section 2.22 (including, without limitation, any Taxes or 
Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this 
Section 2.22) duly paid or payable by such Lender or such of the 
Agents and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) 
arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Indemnification payments 
shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or such of the 
Agents makes written demand therefor.

(e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other 
agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations 
of the Borrowers contained in this Section 2.22 shall survive the 
payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the 
Notes indefinitely.

2.23. LENDER DEFAULT. Notwithstanding anything contained 
herein to the contrary, so long as any Lender shall be in default in 
its obligation to fund its pro rata share of any Revolving Advance or 
make payment in respect of any settlement or purchase under Section 
2.4(e) or 2.4(f) hereof or Section 3.5 hereof, or shall have rejected 
any Revolving Commitment (it being understood that a Lender's refusal 
to fund its pro rata share of an Advance as a result of the failure 
to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 6 or 7 (unless such 
failure is waived by the requisite percentage hereunder of the 
Lenders (to the extent required hereunder), or unless such Advance 
constitutes an Advance properly made pursuant to Section 3.4 or 7.2 
hereof) shall not constitute such a rejection), then such Lender 
shall not be entitled to receive any payments of principal of or 
interest on its pro rata share of the Revolving Loan or its share of 
any commitment or other fees payable hereunder or pursuant to any 
settlement under Section 2.4(e) hereof unless and until (x) the 
Revolving Loan, all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations and all 
other Lender Debt have been paid in full, (y) such failure to fulfill 
its obligation to fund is cured and such Lender shall have paid, as 
and to the extent provided in this Section 2.23, to the applicable 
party, if any, interest on the amount of funds that such Lender 
failed to timely fund or (z) the Lender Debt under this Agreement 
shall have been declared or shall have become immediately due and 
payable, and until the earlier to occur of (x) or (y) above, for 
purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan 
Documents, such Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" hereunder 
and such Lender's Revolving Commitment shall each be deemed to be 
zero ($0). No Revolving Commitment of any Lender shall be increased 
or otherwise affected by any such failure or rejection by any Lender. 
Any payments of principal of or interest on Lender Debt which would, 
but for this Section 2.23, be paid to any Lender, shall be paid to 
the Lenders who shall not be in default under their respective 
Revolving Commitments and who shall not have rejected any Revolving 
Commitment (it being understood that a Lender's refusal to fund its 
pro rata share of an Advance as a result of the failure to satisfy 
any condition set forth in Section 6 or 7 (unless such failure is 
waived by the requisite percentage hereunder of the Lenders (to the 
extent required hereunder), or unless such Advance constitutes an 
Advance properly made pursuant to Section 3.4 or 7.2 hereof) shall 
not constitute such a rejection), for application to Lender Debt or 
to provide Letter of Credit Cash Collateral in such manner and order 
(pro rata among such Lenders) as shall be determined by the 
Administrative Agent.

2.24. DETERMINATIONS BY THE AGENTS. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all 
determinations regarding the inclusion of any Inventory as Eligible 
Inventory, the standards to be applied generally in determining 
Eligible Inventory or the establishment of any reserves against the 
Borrowing Base of any Borrower or the making of any other adjustment 
to the Borrowing Base of any Borrower permitted by this Agreement 
shall be made in the first instance by the Administrative Agent and 
in all instances shall be communicated to the Borrowers by the 
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify 
the Co-Agents of any such determinations communicated to the Borrower

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
to the extent that the Co-Agents were not previously informed 
thereof. In the event that any Co-Agent notifies the Administrative 
Agent in writing that such Co-Agent has made a determination based on 
collateral considerations to exclude any Inventory not then excluded 
from Eligible Inventory, or to establish a more restrictive standard 
of eligibility with respect to Eligible Inventory generally, or to 
establish a new reserve or increase any existing reserve against the 
Borrowing Base of any Borrower or to make any other downward 
adjustment to the Borrowing Base, in each case permitted by this 
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall promptly communicate same 
to the Borrowers and such determination of such Co-Agent shall 
thereafter apply. The Administrative Agent shall give the Lenders 
prompt notice of each adjustment to the Borrowing Base of any 
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.24.

2.25. SUBSTITUTION OF LENDERS. (a) In the event that 
any Lender claims any increased costs under Section 2.9, 2.12(a), 
2.12(b) or 3.8 hereof, and (i) as a consequence of such increased 
costs the effective rate of interest payable to such Lender under 
this Agreement with respect to its pro rata share of the Revolving 
Advances is more than 20 basis points per annum in excess of the 
effective average annual rate of interest payable to the Majority 
Lenders under this Agreement and (ii) Lenders holding at least 75% of 
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments are not subject to such increased 
costs (any such Lender, an "Affected Lender"), the Borrowers may give 
not less than 30 days prior Written Notice (which Written Notice must 
be given within 90 days following the receipt by the Borrowers of 
such claim) to the Administrative Agent and the Affected Lender that 
the Borrowers intend to substitute another financial institution, 
which substitute financial institution must be reasonably acceptable 
to the Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders, provided that 
if more than one Lender claims increased costs arising from the same 
act or condition and such claims are received by a Borrower within 60 
days of each other then the Borrowers may substitute all, but not 
less than all, Lenders making such claims. In the event that the 
proposed substitute financial institution is reasonably acceptable to 
the Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders and the Written 
Notice was properly issued under this Section 2.25, the Affected 
Lender shall sell at par plus accrued interest and the substitute 
financial institution shall purchase, pursuant to assignment 
documentation that is reasonably acceptable to the Affected Lender 
(and in any event provides that such assignment shall be without 
recourse, representation or warranty to the Affected Lender), the 
Notes of the Affected Lender and all rights and claims of such 
Affected Lender under the Loan Documents and the substitute financial 
institution shall assume and the Affected Lender shall be relieved of 
its Revolving Commitment and all other theretofore unperformed 
obligations of the Affected Lender under the Loan Documents. Upon 
the effectiveness of such sale, purchase and assumption (which, in 
any event shall be conditioned upon the payment in full by the 
Borrowers to the Affected Lender in cash of all fees, unreimbursed 
costs and expenses and indemnities accrued and unpaid through such 
effective date, except that such Affected Lender shall not be 
entitled to any accrual in respect of the Tranche B Facility Fee),

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
the substitute financial institution shall become a "Lender" 
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement having a Revolving 
Commitment in the amount of such Affected Lender's Revolving 
Commitment assumed by it and such Revolving Commitment of the 
Affected Lender shall be terminated, provided that all indemnities 
under the Loan Documents shall continue in favor of such Affected 
Lender. 

(b) In the event that the Affected Lender as to which the 
requirements of paragraph (a) above apply is a participant which, 
under Section 13.15(c) hereof, is treated as a Lender, except as 
provided below, the Lender which created such participation shall, 
subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, be obligated to 
repurchase such participation from such Affected Lender and at the 
option of such Affected Lender either sell an equivalent interest in 
the Notes and Revolving Commitment (or a like participation) to the 
substitute financial institution (or to another financial institution 
selected by the Lender who granted such participation which other 
financial institution will not require reimbursement for such higher 
costs as triggered the application of this Section 2.25(b)) or retain 
such participation for its own account and the claim by such Affected 
Lender for increased costs under Section 2.9, 2.12(a) or 2.12(b) 
hereof shall constitute an offer by such Affected Lender to sell to 
the Lender creating such participation the participation of such 
Affected Lender in the event such sale becomes required under this 
Section 2.25. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
this Section 2.25(b), no Lender creating such participation shall be 
obligated to effect any such purchase of a participation under this 
Section 2.25 until such Lender shall have been provided good 
collected funds therefor by the substitute financial institution and 
until the Borrowers have made all payments required under this 
Section 2.25. 

SECTION 3. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF LETTERS OF
CREDIT AND PARTICIPATION THEREIN.

3.1. LETTERS OF CREDIT. Upon the request of a Borrower 
not less than one (1) Business Day in advance, each Issuing Lender 
agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue 
(or in the case of BABC cause, through the issuance of one or more 
L/C Indemnity Agreements, an Issuing Non-Lender Bank to issue) for 
the account of the Borrowers one or more Letters of Credit from time 
to time during the period from the Closing Date until the date which 
occurs 30 days before the Maturity Date in an aggregate amount for 
all Letters of Credit not to exceed at any time $100,000,000, each 
such Letter of Credit upon its issuance to expire on or before the 
earlier of (i) (x) in the case of Merchandise Letters of Credit, the 
date which occurs 180 days from the date of its issuance and (y) in 
the case of Standby Letters of Credit, the date which immediately 
precedes the first anniversary of the date of its issuance and (ii) 
the Maturity Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Letter of Credit shall 
be issued if:

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(a) after giving effect to such issuance of such Letter of 
Credit, (i) the then outstanding aggregate amount of all Letter 
of Credit Obligations would exceed $100,000,000, (ii) if such 
Letter of Credit is a Standby Letter of Credit, the then 
outstanding aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations 
in respect of all Standby Letters of Credit would exceed 
$45,000,000, (iii) as a result of the issuance of such Letter of 
Credit, a prepayment or Letter of Credit Cash Collateral would be 
required under Section 4.1(b) hereof or (iv) as a result of the 
issuance of such Letter of Credit, any Eurodollar Advance would 
be deemed as a Tranche B Advance; 

(b) the applicable Borrower shall have failed to satisfy 
any condition precedent contained in Section 7 hereof (subject to 
Section 7.2 hereof); or

(c) without limiting the rights of the Administrative Agent 
or an Issuing Bank under Section 3.2 hereof, in the case of a 
Merchandise Letter of Credit, such Merchandise Letter of Credit, 
provides that a drawing can be made without presentation to the 
Issuing Bank (or a confirming or negotiating bank acting 
therefor) of documents of title covering the goods subject to 
such Merchandise Letter of Credit, does not provide that the 
Issuing Bank is required to be named as consignee on all bills of 
lading and other documents of title covering such goods or does 
not require, where customary in the ordinary course of business 
to require, delivery of a certificate as to inspection of such 
goods to the Issuing Bank (or a confirming or negotiating bank 
acting therefor) as a condition to drawing thereunder.

3.2 ISSUING THE LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of Credit 
shall be issued on Written Notice in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit 2.4(a) or by notice provided by computer, in each case by the 
applicable Borrower to the Administrative Agent at least one (1) 
Business Day (or such other period as the Administrative Agent and 
the applicable Borrower may agree from time to time) in advance, 
which Written Notice shall specify the date, amount, expiry, 
beneficiary and issuer thereof, and shall be accompanied by the 
Letter of Credit Agreements required by the Issuing Bank and 
acceptable to the Administrative Agent (which shall include the form 
of Letter of Credit requested by the applicable Borrower as agreed to 
by the Issuing Bank), each in form and substance satisfactory to the 
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank. On the date specified by 
the applicable Borrower in such notice and upon fulfillment of the 
applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.1 hereof, the Issuing 
Bank will issue such Letter of Credit in the form specified in such 
notice and such Letter of Credit Agreements. In the event that a 
Letter of Credit is to be issued by an Issuing Non-Lender Bank, then 
the Written Notice issued by the applicable Borrower hereunder shall 
refer to an L/C Indemnity Agreement to be issued by BABC (and shall 
also describe the Letter of Credit to be issued by such Issuing 
Non-Lender Bank) which L/C Indemnity Agreement shall be deemed to be 
a Letter of Credit under this Section 3 as to which BABC shall be 
deemed to be the Issuing Lender. The form of each Letter of Credit 
and the identity of each Issuing Non-Lender Bank shall be 
satisfactory to BABC and the Administrative Agent. Each Letter of 
Credit must be payable solely in United States dollars.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
3.3 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding any 
provisions to the contrary in any Letter of Credit Agreement with 
respect to any Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall:

(a) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the 
Issuing Bank an amount equal to, and in reimbursement for, each 
amount which the Issuing Bank pays under any Letter of Credit on 
or before the earlier of (i) the time specified therefor in the 
applicable Letter of Credit Agreement, and (ii) the date on which 
payment of such amount is made by the Issuing Bank under such 
Letter of Credit; and 

(b) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the 
Issuing Lender interest on any amount remaining unpaid by the 
Borrowers to the Issuing Lender under subsection (a) above from 
the date on which the Issuing Lender pays such amount under any 
Letter of Credit until such amount is reimbursed in full to the 
Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection (a) above, payable on 
demand, at a fluctuating rate per annum (subject to Section 
2.6(c) hereof) equal to the sum of the Reference Rate in effect 
from time to time plus two percentage points (2%).

3.4. REVOLVING ADVANCES. (a) Subject to availability 
under Section 2.2 hereof, and so long as the Lender Debt under the 
Loan Documents shall not have been accelerated and there shall be no 
Event of Default under Section 11.1(f) or Section 11.1(g) hereof and 
to the extent that Letter of Credit Cash Collateral is not available 
to immediately satisfy any Letter of Credit Obligation required to be 
paid under Section 3.3 hereof, the Borrowers shall make each payment 
required under Section 3.3 hereof with the proceeds of a Revolving 
Advance. Each such Revolving Advance shall be deemed to be requested 
by each Borrower, whether or not any Borrower actually requests such 
Revolving Advance in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof, and subject 
to such Borrower's Borrowing Limit and the provisions of Section 
2.4(e) hereof, the Lenders shall make such Revolving Advance unless 
the Lender Debt shall have been accelerated, an Event of Default 
under Section 11.1(f) (other than clause (i) or clause (vi) thereof) 
hereof or Section 11.1(g) (involving a Borrower) hereof has occurred 
and is continuing or such Letter of Credit was not properly issuable 
under Section 3.1 hereof (it being understood that any Letter of 
Credit issued pursuant to an election by the Administrative Agent 
made under Section 7.2 hereof and as to which no contrary Direction 
Letter has been received by the Administrative Agent shall be deemed 
properly issuable under Section 3.1 hereof).

(b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably requests each such 
Revolving Advance and irrevocably authorizes and directs the 
Administrative Agent to apply the proceeds thereof directly to the 
Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the obligations of the Borrowers 
under Section 3.3 hereof in respect of such Letter of Credit.

(c) No Revolving Advance shall be required to be made by 
the Lenders under this Section 3.4 to the extent prohibited by 
applicable law, following any acceleration of the Lender Debt under 
the Loan Documents or while any Event of Default under Section 
11.1(f) (other than clause (i) or clause or clause (vi) thereof) or 
Section 11.1(g) (involving a Borrower) hereof has occurred and is 
continuing.

3.5. SETTLEMENT BY LENDERS WITH ISSUING BANK. (a) With 
respect to any Letter of Credit issued or caused to be issued by an 
Issuing Lender in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1 
hereof, the Issuing Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and 
unconditionally to have sold and transferred to each other Lender 
without recourse or warranty, and each such other Lender shall be 
deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received 
from the Issuing Lender an undivided interest and participation, to 
the extent of such Lender's pro rata share of the Revolving Credit 
Facility Commitment in effect from time to time, in such Letter of 
Credit and all Letter of Credit Obligations relating to such Letter 
of Credit and all Letter of Credit Agreements and Loan Documents 
securing, guaranteeing, supporting or otherwise benefiting the 
payment of such Letter of Credit Obligations.

(b) With respect to any Letter of Credit in which the 
Lenders have purchased participation, if any reimbursement or other 
obligation under Section 3.3 hereof is not paid when due to the 
Issuing Lender with respect to any such Letter of Credit in 
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Issuing Lender 
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent to that effect, and 
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the other Lenders of 
the amount of such obligation and each Lender shall, subject to 
Section 2.4(e) hereof, immediately pay to the Administrative Agent 
for the benefit of the Issuing Lender, in lawful money of the United 
States and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Lender's pro 
rata share (based on its share of the Revolving Credit Facility 
Commitment at such time) of the amount of such unpaid obligation, it 
being understood that the Issuing Lender shall not be paid its pro 
rata share (based on its share of the Revolving Credit Facility 
Commitment then in effect) of such reimbursement or other obligation. 
Promptly after the Issuing Lender receives a payment on account of 
such an obligation with respect to any such Letter of Credit (other 
than under this paragraph (b)), the Issuing Lender shall promptly pay 
to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall 
promptly pay to each other Lender which funded its participation 
therein, in lawful money of the United States and in the kind of 
funds so received, an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share 
thereof.

(c) Upon the request of any Lender having purchased a 
participation in a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall 
furnish to such Lender copies of such Letter of Credit and any Letter 
of Credit Agreements related thereto as may be reasonably requested 
by such Lender.

(d) The obligation of each Lender to make payments under 
paragraph (b) above shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall 
be made under all circumstances (except as otherwise expressly 
provided in paragraph (a) above), including, without limitation, any 
of the circumstances referred to in Section 3.7(b) hereof. 

(e) If any payment received on account of any reimbursement 
or other obligation with respect to a Letter of Credit and 
distributed to a Lender as a participant under Section 3.5(b) or (f) 
is thereafter recovered from the Issuing Lender in connection with

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding relating to any Borrower, any 
other Credit Party or otherwise, each Lender which received such 
distribution shall, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to 
the Issuing Lender such Lender's ratable share of the amount so 
recovered together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable 
share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's 
required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered) of any 
interest or other amount paid or payable by the Issuing Lender in 
respect of the total amount so recovered.

(f) Upon the expiration of any Letter of Credit or receipt 
by the Issuing Lender of payment on account of any reimbursement or 
other obligation with respect to any Letter of Credit, the Issuing 
Lender, in its capacity as Lender, shall, subject to Section 2.4(e) 
hereof, unconditionally settle with the Lenders and, with respect to 
the receipt of a reimbursement obligation, pay to the Administrative 
Agent, by paying to the Payment Account in same day funds, for 
reimbursement to the Lenders, such amount as may be necessary to 
adjust the aggregate of the Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit 
Obligations of each Lender so that all Lenders are, with respect to 
the Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Obligations, pro rata.

(g) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to waive any 
rights of any Lender against the Administrative Agent or any Issuing 
Lender arising from any such Person's gross negligence or wilful 
misconduct.

3.6 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. (a) Subject to Section 
3.6(c) hereof, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent 
for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders on the last day of each 
calendar month of each year and on the date of the full drawing, 
cancellation, expiration or termination of any Letter of Credit, a 
fee in respect of such Letter of Credit for such calendar month or 
shorter period, at a rate of, with respect to Standby Letters of 
Credit, two percent (2%) per annum and with respect to Merchandise 
Letters of Credit, one and three-quarters percent (1-3/4%) per annum 
(in each case calculated on the average daily undrawn amount of such 
Letter of Credit for such calendar month or shorter period and 
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 
year of 360 days).

(b) In addition to other amounts payable under this Section 
3.6, the Borrowers shall pay to each Issuing Bank, on demand, sums 
equal to all fees, charges and expenses including, without 
limitation, any fee for the extension of credit, which such Issuing 
Bank may impose, pay or incur in connection with the issuance, 
amendment, administration, transfer or cancellation of any or all 
Letters of Credit or in connection with any payment by such Issuing 
Bank thereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the 
Issuing Bank which has issued a Letter of Credit is Bank of America 
National Trust and Savings Association or a Lender (other than BABC 
which has issued an L/C Indemnity Agreement), the Borrowers shall not 
be obligated to pay a fee under this Section 3.6(b) that is payable 
solely in respect of the extension of credit; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that 
in the event that Bank of America National Trust and Savings

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Association shall charge any such fee in respect of the extension of 
credit, such fee shall be paid solely by BABC. Each Borrower hereby 
acknowledges that Bank of America National Trust and Savings 
Association has provided to such Borrower a schedule of fees and 
charges for opening, amending, transferring or negotiating a letter 
of credit and the like, which fees and charges may change from time 
to time based on Bank of America National Trust and Savings 
Association's desired return and other factors, including, without 
limitation, volume of letter of credit business and reserve 
requirements. 

(c) During the continuation of any Event of Default, fees 
payable in respect of Letters of Credit shall accrue and be payable 
at a per annum rate two percent (2%) in excess of the fees otherwise 
payable in respect of Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 3.6(a) 
hereof.

3.7. INDEMNIFICATION: NATURE OF THE ISSUING BANK'S 
DUTIES. (a) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and save harmless 
each Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender from and against any and 
all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and 
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and the allocated 
costs and expenses of in-house counsel) which such Agent, the Issuing 
Bank or such Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, 
direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit or 
any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection therewith by 
the Issuing Bank or (ii) any action or proceeding arising from or in 
connection with the Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, 
any action or proceeding relating to a court order, injunction, or 
other process or decree restraining or seeking to restrain the 
Issuing Bank from paying any amount under any Letter of Credit. The 
indemnities contained in this Section 3.7 shall survive the 
expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and this Agreement 
and shall be payable upon demand.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, 
the obligations of the Borrowers to the Lenders in respect of Letter 
of Credit Obligations shall be absolute, unconditional and 
irrevocable, and shall be paid without off-set, deduction or 
withholding of any kind and strictly in accordance with the terms 
hereof under all circumstances and happenings whatsoever, including, 
without limitation, any of the following circumstances (or any 
others, whether or not similar to any of the following 
circumstances):

(i) any renewal, extension or modification of any 
Letter of Credit (but not any increase in the outstanding amount 
thereof) so long as the terms of such Letter of Credit after 
giving effect to such extension, renewal or modification would be 
permitted hereunder, or any lack of validity or enforceability of 
or any change in the terms of any Letter of Credit or any 
agreement or instrument relating thereto;

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or 
other right which any Borrower may have at any time against the 
beneficiary, or any transferee, of any Letter of Credit, or the 
Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other 
Person;

(iii) any draft, certificate or other document 
presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, 
fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any 
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

(iv) any lack of validity, effectiveness or 
sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or 
purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the 
rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in 
part;

(v) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise 
of any document required in order to make a drawing under any 
Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof;

(vi) any failure of the beneficiary of a Letter of 
Credit to substantially comply with the conditions required in 
order to draw upon any Letter of Credit; or

(vii) any misapplication by the beneficiary of any 
Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter 
of Credit; 

PROVIDED that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each 
Lender shall not be relieved of any liability it may otherwise have 
as a result of its gross negligence or wilful misconduct. In the 
event that the Borrowers are compelled by applicable law to make any 
deduction or withholding from any amount payable under this Section 
3, then, unless prohibited by applicable law and except as provided 
in Section 2.22(b)(iii) hereof, the Borrowers shall pay to each 
Issuing Bank such additional amount as will result in the receipt by 
such Issuing Bank of a net sum equal to the sum it would have 
received if no such deduction or withholding had been required to be 
made.

3.8. INCREASED COSTS. (a) CHANGE IN LAW GENERALLY. If 
any law, treaty, order, directive, rule or regulation adopted, issued 
or becoming effective after the Closing Date or any change in any law 
or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or 
administrative or governmental authority charged with the 
administration thereof (in any case, whether or not having the force 
of law) or compliance by any Issuing Lender or Lender with respect 
thereto from that in effect as of the Closing Date shall either (i) 
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or 
similar requirement against letters of credit issued by the Issuing 
Lender or any Lender or participation therein or (ii) impose on the 
Issuing Lender or such Lender any other condition regarding letters 
of credit or participation therein, and the result of any event 
referred to in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase 
the cost to the Issuing Lender of issuing or maintaining, or, in the

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
case of such Lender, having a participation in, Letters of Credit 
then, upon demand by the Issuing Lender or such Lender (with a copy 
to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall promptly pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Lender or such 
Lender from time to time as specified by the Issuing Lender or such 
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), additional amounts 
which shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing Lender or such 
Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to such increased 
cost, and amount and computation thereof, incurred by the Issuing 
Lender or such Lender as a result of any event mentioned in clause 
(i) or (ii) above, submitted by the Issuing Lender or such Lender to 
the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, shall be conclusive and 
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(b) CAPITAL. If any law, treaty, order, directive, rule or 
regulations shall be adopted, issued or becoming effective after the 
Closing Date or if any change in any law, treaty, order, directive, 
role or regulation from that in effect on the Closing Date or in the 
interpretation thereof by any governmental or other regulatory 
authority charged with the administration thereof (in any case, 
whether or not having the force of law) and including in any event, 
all risk based capital guidelines heretofore adopted by the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the Board or any other banking 
regulatory agency, domestic or foreign, to the extent that any 
provision contained therein does not have to be complied with as of 
the date hereof, shall, or if the compliance by any Issuing Lender or 
any Lender with any guideline or request from any central bank or 
other governmental authority, shall affect or would affect the amount 
of capital required or expected to be maintained by the Issuing 
Lender or such Lender or any affiliate of such Issuing Lender or 
Lender, and the Issuing Lender or such Lender determines that the 
amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of 
letters of credit or participation therein (or similar contingent 
obligations), then, upon demand by the Issuing Lender or such Lender, 
as the case may be (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the 
Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of 
the Issuing Lender or such Lender from time to time such additional 
amounts as may be specified by the Issuing Lender or such Lender as 
sufficient to compensate it in light of such circumstances, to the 
extent that the Issuing Lender or such Lender determines such 
increase in capital to be allocable to the issuance or maintenance of 
the Letters of Credit, or, in the case of such Lender, to its 
participation in the Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such 
amounts submitted to the Borrowers by the Issuing Lender or such 
Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent 
manifest error.

3.9. UNIFORM CUSTOMS AND PRACTICE. The Uniform Customs 
and Practice for Documentary Credits as most recently published by 
the International Chamber of Commerce and as revised from time to 
time ("UCP") shall in all respects be deemed a part of this Section 3 
as if incorporated herein with respect to the Letters of Credit.

and payment as hereinafter provided, be due and payable on the 
Maturity Date.

(b) (i) If at any time (A) while the Borrowers are in 
compliance with the financial test contained in Schedule 4.1(b) 
hereto and (B) following satisfaction (subject to Section 9.16(c) 
hereof) of the EBITDA Test at least once if such time is on or after

(2) the outstanding amount of Letter of Credit Obligations of such 
Borrower reduced by all Letter of Credit Cash Collateral held by the 
Administrative Agent therefor, exceeds such Borrower's Borrowing 
Limit at such time, the Borrowers shall (to the extent necessary to 
eliminate such excess) immediately prepay the Revolving Loan until 
the Revolving Loan has been reduced to zero and thereafter provide to 
the Administrative Agent additional Letter of Credit Cash Collateral 
for all then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations.

(ii) If at any time the Borrowers either (A) are not 
in compliance with the financial test contained in Schedule 4.1(b) 
hereto or (B) have not satisfied (subject to Section 9.16(c) hereof) 
the EBITDA Test at least once if such time is on or after the EBITDA 
Test Trigger Date, and the sum of (x) the then outstanding principal 
amount of the Revolving Advances made to any Borrower, PLUS (y) the 
outstanding amount of Letter of Credit Obligations of such Borrower 
reduced by all Letter of Credit Cash Collateral held by the 
Administrative Agent therefor, exceeds 90% of such Borrower's 
Borrowing Limit at such time, the Borrowers shall (to the extent 
necessary to eliminate such excess) immediately prepay the Revolving 
Loan until the Revolving Loan has been reduced to zero and thereafter 
provide to the Administrative Agent additional Letter of Credit Cash 
Collateral for all then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations.

Revolving Loan until the Revolving Loan has been reduced to zero and 
thereafter provide to the Administrative Agent Letter of Credit Cash 
Collateral for all then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations.

Indebtedness and Lender Debt and shall provide Letter of Credit Cash 
Collateral for all then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(d) The Borrowers shall designate, upon prior Written 
Notice to the Administrative Agent, a period of at least thirty (30) 
consecutive days during each three month period which commences on 
November 15 and ends on February 15 (any such thirty day period so 
designated, a "Cleanup Period"). Each Written Notice under this 
paragraph shall be given prior to January 10 for the three month 
period ending on the immediately following February 15. At all times 
during each Cleanup Period the Borrowers shall cause the aggregate 
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan to be zero ($0))

remain outstanding for up to one Business Day during any Cleanup 
Period.

(e) Any prepayment of principal of the Revolving Loan 
pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be made, except as provided in

Loan required under Section 4.1(a) or Section 4.1(c) hereof shall be 
accompanied by the payment of interest accrued and unpaid on the 
amount of such prepayment through the date of prepayment. Each 
prepayment of the Revolving Loan required under Section 4.1(b), 
Section 2.19(b) or Section 2.20(a) hereof shall be applied in the 
manner and order as provided in Section 4.4 hereof.

4.2 PAYMENT FROM INSURANCE AND OTHER PROCEEDS. (a) 
Except as provided in paragraph (b) below, not later than the 
fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the receipt by the 
Administrative Agent or any Credit Party of any proceeds of any 
insurance required to be maintained pursuant to any Loan Document on 
account of each separate loss, damage or injury in excess of 
$1,000,000 (or, if there shall be continuing an Event of Default, of 
any amount of proceeds) to any tangible property of such Credit Party 
in which the Credit Parties are required hereunder to provide a Lien 
in favor of the Administrative Agent, such Credit Party shall notify 
the Administrative Agent of any such receipt by such Credit Party in 
writing or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing, and not later 
than the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following receipt by the 
Administrative Agent or such Credit Party of $1,000,000 or more of 
such proceeds (or, if there shall be continuing an Event of Default, 
of any amount of proceeds), there shall become due and payable a 
prepayment of principal in an amount equal to such proceeds (with 
permanent reduction (except to the extent of any reserve created upon 
prepayment as contemplated in Section 4.2(b)(ii) hereof), occurring 
on the making of such prepayment, in the Revolving Credit Facility 
Commitment (applied first to the Tranche A Commitment Amount until 
reduced to zero ($0) and then to the Tranche B Commitment Amount 
until reduced to zero ($0)) in the case of loss of or damage or 
injury to property other than Inventory). Each prepayment from such 
proceeds shall be applied in the manner and order provided in Section 
4.4 hereof and shall be accompanied by the payment of interest 
accrued and unpaid on the amount of such prepayment through the date 
of such prepayment. Any such prepayment of the Revolving Loan shall 
be made without penalty or premium but shall be subject to payment of 
any applicable indemnity obligations pursuant to Section 2.12 hereof. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(b) (i) In the case of the receipt of proceeds described in 
paragraph (a) of this Section 4.2 in respect of tangible property of 
a Credit Party other than Inventory, such Credit Party may elect, by 
Written Notice delivered to the Administrative Agent not later than 
the day on which a prepayment would otherwise be required, to apply 
all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds for the purpose of 
replacing, repairing, restoring or rebuilding the relevant tangible 
property, and, in such event, any required prepayment under the first 
sentence of this Section 4.2, shall be reduced dollar for dollar by 
the amount of such election. An election under this paragraph 
4.2(b)(i) shall not be effective unless:

(A) at the time of such election no Default or 
Event of Default is continuing;

(B) such Credit Party shall have certified to the 
Administrative Agent that:

(x) the proceeds of the insurance adjustment for 
such loss, damage or injury, together with other 
funds available to such Credit Party (including 
proceeds of Revolving Advances) and which such 
Credit Party is permitted to utilize for such 
purpose, shall be sufficient to completely effect 
such replacement, repair, restoration or 
rebuilding in accordance with all applicable laws, 
regulations and ordinances; and

(y) to the best knowledge of such Credit Party no 
Default or Event of Default will arise as a result 
of such loss, damage, injury, replacement, repair 
or rebuilding; and

(C) if the amount of proceeds in question exceeds 
$10,000,000, such Credit Party shall have obtained the prior 
written consent of the Majority Lenders (which consent will 
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such election.

(ii) In the event of an election by a Credit Party under 
Section 4.2(b)(i) hereof, such Credit Party shall nonetheless apply 
the proceeds of any insurance received in respect of the applicable 
tangible property to the repayment of the Revolving Loan at the time 
required under Section 4.2(a) hereof, and the Administrative Agent 
shall create a reserve against the Borrowing Base of each Borrower 
(as allocated by the Administrative Agent) under the Revolving Credit 
Facility Commitment in the amount of such prepayment, which reserve 
shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount expended by or on 
behalf of such Credit Party from time to time for the replacement 
(which shall include rebuilding within the same geographical area), 
repair, restoration or rebuilding of such tangible property. In 
addition, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to require 
proof, as a condition to the making of any reduction in such reserve, 
that the proceeds of such withdrawal or advance are being applied to 
the purposes permitted hereunder and that no Default or Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(c) In the event that any Credit Party receives any 
proceeds of any condemnation, confiscation, taking or similar award 
in an amount exceeding $1,000,000 (or, if an Event of Default or 
Default is then continuing, of any amount), in respect of property of 
any Credit Party in which the Credit Parties are required hereunder 
to provide a Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent, then such 
proceeds shall be treated in the same manner and subject to the same 
prepayment provisions as proceeds of insurance on property other than 
Inventory under this Section 4.2.

4.3 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Each Borrower may, in 
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, from time to time 
borrow, prepay and re-borrow Revolving Advances.

4.4 PROCEDURES FOR PAYMENT. (a) Unless otherwise 
requested by any Borrower in a Written Notice to the Administrative 
Agent, all prepayments of the Revolving Loan under Sections 2.19(b), 
2.20(b), 4.1(b) and 4.2 shall be applied first to Reference Rate 
Advances which are Tranche B Advances until paid in full, then to 
Reference Rate Advances which are Tranche A Advances until paid in 
full and last to Eurodollar Advances. Unless requested to do so in a 
Written Notice by any Borrower to the Administrative Agent, such 
prepayments of the Revolving Loan remaining after application to all 
Reference Rate Advances shall not be applied to any portion of the 
Revolving Loan that constitutes a Eurodollar Advance until the last 
day of the respective Interest Period therefor or the earlier 
maturity of such portion of such Revolving Advance by acceleration or 
otherwise, and pending such application, and subject to Section 2.20 
hereof, such remaining portion of such prepayment shall be invested 
and reinvested by and in the name of the Administrative Agent in 
investments of the type permitted under Section 10.4(b) hereof with 
the type and maturity of such investments to be mutually agreed to by 
the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers; PROVIDED, that, so long 
as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Administrative Agent shall upon the written request 
of the Borrowers release any such funds to the Borrowers. All 
interest earned on such investments shall be for the account and risk 
of the Borrowers. Interest earned on any portion of principal 
applied to the Eurodollar Advance shall be, so long as no Default or 
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and to the 
extent received by the Administrative Agent, turned over to the 
Borrowers promptly following application of such principal to such 
Eurodollar Advance, as the Administrative Agent shall determine. As 
additional collateral security for the Lender Debt, each Borrower 
hereby grants to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the 
Agents and the ratable benefit of the Lenders a security interest in 
(x) any such prepayments and any investments thereof, including, 
without limitation, any certificates or instruments evidencing any 
such investments, and all claims and choses in action in respect of 
the foregoing, (y) any interest or other payment made in respect of 
such investments and (z) any and all proceeds of any of the above and 
all claims and causes in action in respect of the foregoing (all of 
the foregoing constituting part of the Collateral). To the extent 
the Administrative Agent makes any such investments, each Borrower 
hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to hold any certificate or 
instrument evidencing such investments.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(b) Subject to Section 2.20 hereof, all amounts received by 
the Administrative Agent from any Credit Party during any Cleanup 
Period shall be invested and reinvested by and in the name of the 
Administrative Agent in investments of the type permitted under 
Section 10.4 hereof with the type and maturity of such investments to 
be mutually agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers; 
PROVIDED, that so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall upon the 
request of the Borrowers release any such funds to the Borrowers. 
All interest earned on such investments shall be for the account and 
risk of the Borrowers. As additional collateral security for the 
Lender Debt, each Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent 
for the benefit of the Agents and the ratable benefit of the Lenders 
a security interest in (x) any such prepayments and any investments 
thereof, including, without limitation, any certificates or 
instruments evidencing any such investments, and all claims and 
causes in action in respect of the foregoing, (y) any interest or 
other payment made in respect of such investments and (z) any and all 
proceeds of any of the above and all claims and causes in action in 
respect of the foregoing (all of the foregoing constituting part of 
the Collateral). To the extent the Administrative Agent makes any 
such investments, each Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative 
Agent to hold any certificate or instrument evidencing such 
investments.

4.5 COMMITMENT FEES. The Borrowers shall pay to the 
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders on the 
first day of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the date of 
this Agreement and thereafter on the first day of each fiscal quarter 
commencing thereafter, until the date of the expiration, termination 
or cancellation of the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment and on 
such date, a commitment fee for the quarter or shorter period just 
ended of one-half of one percent (.5%) per annum on the amount equal 
to the excess of (i) the daily average of the sum of the Tranche A

quarter or shorter period over (ii) the sum of (A) the average daily 
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan during such 
quarter or shorter period and (B) the average daily outstanding 
Letter of Credit Obligations during such quarter or shorter period. 
In the event that the Closing Date shall not occur on or prior to 
July 15, 1994, the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment shall expire 
on July 16, 1994.

4.6. FACILITY FEES. (a) On the Closing Date, the 
Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of 
the Lenders (to be distributed to the Lenders in accordance with 
Schedule 4.6 hereof) a facility fee in respect of the Tranche A 
Commitment Amount (the "Tranche A Facility Fee") in the amount of 
$5,400,000.

(b) The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for 
the account of the Lenders (to be distributed to the Lenders in

Fee"), payable as follows: (i) on the Closing Date, the sum of 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
$1,000,000; and (ii) on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and 
at the end of each period of three months thereafter, a payment of 
$250,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrowers' obligation to 
continue to make payments under this clause (ii) shall cease from and 
after the date, if any, that the Tranche B Commitment Amount has been 
reduced to zero in accordance with Section 2.5(c) hereof.

(c) The entire Tranche A Facility Fee and the entire 
Tranche B Facility Fee shall be earned on the date hereof. The

Lien of the Administrative Agent in the property covered thereby.

desirable without the signature of such Credit Party where permitted 
by law.

(c) In the event that any re-recording or refiling of any 
financing statement (or the filing of any statements of continuation 
or amendment or assignment of any financing statement) is required to 
protect and preserve such Lien, the Credit Parties shall, at their 
cost and expense, cause the same to be recorded and/or refiled at the 
time and in the manner requested by the Administrative Agent.

Credit Party as a party thereto), of all then existing or thereafter 
incurred Lender Debt (or in the sole discretion of the Agents, an 
amendment, in form and substance satisfactory to each Agent, to any 
guaranty executed and delivered pursuant to Section 5.8(a) above to 
add such Subsidiary as a guarantor thereunder) and such other 
Security Documents and related documents, instruments and 
certificates, in form and substance satisfactory to the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent, as the Administrative Agent shall request in 
order to grant to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the 
Agents and the ratable benefit of the Lenders a valid, perfected and

prohibited by this Agreement.

$30,000,000 OF ACCEPTABLE SUBORDINATED DEBT. (a) The Administrative 
Agent, upon receipt of a written request by the Borrowers made 
contemporaneously with or at any time after receipt by one or more 
Credit Parties of at least $30,000,000 as the gross cash proceeds

Agent of the net cash proceeds of such issuance (as described in 
paragraph (a) of this Section 5.9), any provisions of the Loan 
Documents requiring any Credit Party to grant to the Administrative 
Agent a Lien on such Credit Party's assets shall be deemed not to 
apply to such Credit Party's real property (other than the Master 
Sublease) and Equipment (other than any computer data processing 
hardware or other Equipment (including, without limitation, any 
point-of-sale equipment) that is used to store, generate or maintain

be provided by recognized insurers reasonably acceptable to the 
Administrative Agent. All insurance on such real and personal 
property shall contain an endorsement, in form and substance

endorsement, or an independent instrument furnished to the 
Administrative Agent, shall provide that the insurance companies add

ten (10)) days' prior Written Notice and (except in the case of 
cancellation for non-payment of premium) obtain the Agents' and 
Majority Lenders' prior written approval before any cancellation, or 
material decrease in amount of, or other material change in, coverage 
provided by or cancellation of such policy or policies of insurance 
and that no act, omission or default of the Ames or any of its 
Subsidiaries or any other Person shall affect the right of the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender to recover under such policy or 
policies of insurance in case of loss or damages.

(b) The Credit Parties shall, at their sole cost and 
expense, maintain comprehensive general liability insurance covering 
themselves and their Subsidiaries on an "occurrence basis" (unless 
such insurance cannot be reasonably obtained at commercially 
reasonable rates, in which case such insurance shall be on a "claims 
made" basis) against claims for personal injury, bodily injury and 
property damage with a minimum limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence 
with excess coverage under umbrella liability insurance policies with

as its interest appears, and all such policies shall be collaterally 
assigned to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Agents 
and the ratable benefit of the Lenders pursuant to one or more 
assignment agreements acceptable in form and substance to the 
Administrative Agent.

(f) All policies of liability insurance required to be 
maintained under this Agreement shall name the Administrative Agent 
and shall cover each Lender as an additional insured, contain a 
requirement for thirty (30) (or, in the case of nonpayment of 
premium, ten (10)) day notice, and (except in the case of 
cancellation for non-payment of premium) the Agents' and the Majority 
Lenders' prior written approval, of any cancellation, or any material 
decrease in amount of or other material change in, coverage, and be 
in form and with insurers recognized as adequate by the 
Administrative Agent and, except as required hereby, all such 
policies shall be in such amounts as may be reasonably satisfactory 
to the Agents and the Majority Lenders. Each Credit Party shall 
deliver to the Administrative Agent a copy of each policy of 
insurance and, at the Administrative Agent's request, evidence of 
payment of all premiums therefor and of compliance with all 
provisions of this Agreement. In addition, Each Credit Party shall 
notify the Administrative Agent promptly of any occurrence (it being 
understood that a general decline in the real estate market shall not 
constitute such an occurrence) causing a material loss or decline in 
value of any real or personal property and the estimated (or actual, 
if available) amount of such loss or decline. Each Credit Party each 
irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent 
(and all officers, employees or agents designated by the 
Administrative Agent) as the and lawful attorney (and agent-in-fact), 
acting at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of 
an Event of Default, for the purpose of making, settling and 
adjusting claims under such policies of insurance, endorsing the name 
of such Credit Party on any check, draft, instrument or other item of 
payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance, and for 
making all determinations and decisions with respect to such policies 
of insurance. In the event any Credit Party thereof at any time or 
times hereafter shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies 
of insurance required above or to pay any premium in whole or in part 
relating thereto, the Administrative Agent, without waiving or 
releasing any obligations or default of any Person hereunder, may at

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
any time or times thereafter (but shall not be obligated to) obtain 
and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take 
any other action with respect thereto which the Administrative Agent 
deems advisable. All sums so incurred by the Administrative Agent, 
including reasonable attorneys' fees, allocated costs and expenses of 
in-house counsel, court costs, expenses and other charges relating 
thereto, shall be payable, on demand, by Ames or any of its 
Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent and shall be additional 
Lender Debt hereunder secured by the Collateral.

(g) The Administrative Agent reserves the right at any 
time, upon a material change of Ames' or any of its Subsidiaries' 
risk profile, to require additional forms and limits of insurance 
which, in the Administrative Agent's reasonable opinion, will 
adequately protect any rights and interests of any Agent or any 
Lender in or to the Collateral, the Lender Debt or any Loan 
Documents.

(h) All insurance policy minimum amounts set forth in this 
Section 9.3 are subject to the continuing availability of such 
insurance at commercially reasonable rates, and to the extent such 
policy minimum amounts are not so available, the Credit Parties shall 
obtain policies with the maximum amounts of coverage then available 
at commercially reasonable rates.

9.4. BOOKS AND RESERVES. Each Credit Party shall and 
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to:

(a) maintain, at all times, accurate and complete books, 
records and accounts in which accurate and correct entries shall be 
made of its transactions which, in the case of Ames, are in 
accordance with GAAP; and 

(b) by means of appropriate entries, reflect in its 
accounts and in all financial statements furnished pursuant to 
Section 9.1 hereof proper liabilities and reserves for all taxes and 
proper provision for depreciation and amortization of its properties 
and bad debts, all in accordance with GAAP. 

9.5 PROPERTIES IN GOOD CONDITION. Each Credit Party 
shall keep, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to keep, its 
material properties in good repair, working order and condition, 
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and, from time to time, make all 
necessary and proper repairs, renewals, replacements, additions and 
improvements thereto, so that the business carried on may be 
conducted at all times in accordance with prudent business 
management.

9.6 MAINTENANCE OF EXISTENCE, ETC. Subject to Section 
10.5 hereof, each Credit Party shall preserve and maintain, and cause 
each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain, its statutory 
existence and corporate or partnership franchises, as the case may 
be.

9.7 FIELD EXAMINATIONS AND INSPECTIONS. Each Credit 
Party shall allow, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to allow,

field examinations of such Credit Party and its Subsidiaries, at the 
Borrowers' expense as to reasonable expenses of such Agent and such 
designees as such Agent may request and (ii) any representative of 
any Agent, at the expense of the Borrowers, to visit and visually 
inspect any of their respective properties, to receive copies of all

respective books of account and other records and files, to make 
copies thereof and to discuss their respective affairs, business, 
finances and accounts with their respective officers and employees 
and independent accountants (and each of the Credit Parties hereby 
irrevocably authorizes the independent accountants of the Credit 
Parties to discuss with each of the Agents the financial affairs of 
Ames and its Subsidiaries), all at such reasonable times during 
normal business hours and as often as any Agent may reasonably 
request upon reasonable notice (or, during the continuance of a 
Default or Event of Default, without notice), and the Credit Parties 
shall, to the extent reasonably requested by any Agent, confirm such 
authorization by sending to such independent accountants a letter 
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 6.23. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent 
shall have the right to invite one or more Lenders to participate in 
any field examination conducted pursuant to this Section 9.7. The 
Borrowers hereby acknowledge that the Agents shall require at least 
two field examinations pursuant to this Section 9.7 during each 
Fiscal Year.

9.8. PAY INDEBTEDNESS TO LENDERS AND PERFORM OTHER 
COVENANTS. The Borrowers shall (a) make full and timely payment of 
all payments required to be made by the Borrowers in respect of the 
Lender Debt, including without limitation, the Revolving Loan, 
whether now existing or hereafter arising, (b) and each of the Credit 
Parties shall comply with all the terms and covenants contained in 
each Loan Document to which such Credit Party is a party, all at the 
times and places and in the manner set forth therein and (c) except 
for the filing of continuation statements and the making of other 
filings by the Administrative Agent as secured party or assignee, at 
all times take all action necessary to maintain the Liens provided 
for under or pursuant to this Agreement or any Security Document as 
valid and perfected Liens on the property intended to be covered 
thereby (subject to no other Liens except those Liens expressly 
permitted under Section 10.2 hereof) and supply all information to 
the Administrative Agent or the Lenders necessary for such 
maintenance.

9.9. CYCLE COUNTS. Each Borrower shall, and shall engage 
one or more Persons acceptable to the Agents (it being understood 
that each of Washington Inventory Service and RGIS Inventory Service 
is acceptable to the Agents) to, conduct cycle counts of its 
Inventory at such times and in such manner as is consistent with such 
Borrower's historical practices.

9.10. REPORTING OF MISREPRESENTATIONS. In the event that 
any Credit Party discovers that any representation or warranty made 
in any Loan Document by any Credit Party was incorrect in any 
material respect when made, such Credit Party shall promptly report 
the same to the Administrative Agent and take, or cause to be taken, 
all available steps to correct such misrepresentation or breach of 
warranty.

9.11. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each Credit Party shall, and 
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply and duly observe in 
all material respects with all laws and regulations and all rules and

limitation, ERISA, those regarding the collection, payment and 
deposit of employees' income, unemployment and social security taxes 
and those relating to public and employee health and safety, except a 
non-compliance or failure to observe that could not reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

9.12. ERISA. (a) Each Credit Party shall pay and 
discharge, and shall cause each ERISA Affiliate to pay and discharge, 
when due (including any permissible extensions) any liability imposed 
upon it pursuant to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA.

(b) Each Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative 
Agent promptly, and in any event within ten (10) days, after

(i) such party knows, or has reason to know, of the 
occurrence of any Reportable Event (as defined in Section 4043(b) 
of ERISA) with respect to any Pension Benefit Plan ("Reportable 
Event"), a copy of the materials that are filed by the applicable 
plan administrator with the PBGC, or the materials that would 
have been filed if the PBGC had not waived the notice 
requirements;

(ii) the receipt of notice by such Credit Party or any 
ERISA Affiliate or any administrator of any Pension Benefit Plan 
who is an employee of such Credit Party or any ERISA Affiliate 
from the PBGC of the PBGC's intention to terminate any such 
Pension Benefit Plan or to appoint a trustee to administer any 
such Pension Benefit Plan, a copy of such notice;

<PAGE>
(v) such Credit Party or any ERISA Affiliate knows or 
has reason to know of any event or condition which might

9.13. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Credit Party shall, and 
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at its cost and expense, 
upon request of the Administrative Agent, duly execute and deliver, 
or cause to be duly executed and delivered, to the Administrative 
Agent such further instruments and do and cause to be done such 
further acts as may be necessary or proper in the reasonable opinion 
of the Administrative Agent to carry out more effectually the 
provisions and purposes of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

9.14. APPRAISALS. The Borrowers shall allow each of the 
Agents and their respective designees to perform, and shall assist 
each of the Agents and their respective designees in performing, 
appraisals of the Borrowers' Inventory, at the expense of the 
Borrowers from time to time as any of the Agents shall direct, 
provided that no Agent shall be entitled to perform more than one 
such inventory appraisal in any fiscal quarter unless an Event of 
Default shall be continuing in which case such limitation shall not 
apply. The Borrowers hereby acknowledge that the Agents shall 
require at least one such inventory appraisal to be performed during 
each Fiscal Year. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained 
herein, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing the Borrowers shall not be responsible under this Section 
9.14 for costs and expenses of the Agents in connection with any such 
appraisals in excess of $40,000 in any Fiscal Year.

9.15 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, ETC. (a) Each Credit Party 
shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to (i) comply in all 
material respects with the Environmental Laws applicable to it.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(b) Each Credit Party shall fully and promptly pay, 
discharge, defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party 
from and against any action, claim, loss, liability, damage, cost, 
deficiency, fine, penalty or expense (including, without limitation, 
reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements, investigation, removal, 
cleanup and remedial costs and reasonable modification costs incurred 
to permit continued or resumed normal operation of the Facilities) 
suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Party, whether as mortgagee 
pursuant to any Mortgage, as mortgagee in possession, or as successor 
in interest to such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries as owner, 
operator or lessee of any Facilities by virtue of foreclosure or 
acceptance in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise: (i) under or on 
account of the Environmental Laws as they may apply to any Credit 
Party, any of its Subsidiaries or the Facilities, including the 
assertion of any Lien thereunder; and (ii) with respect to any 
Environmental Claim, Release or Contaminant affecting such 
Facilities, whether or not the same originates or emanates from such 
Facilities or any contiguous real estate, including any loss of value 
of such Facilities as a result of a Release of any Contaminant. The 
foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or earlier 
termination of this Agreement and the satisfaction of the Lender Debt 
under the Loan Documents. Further, the foregoing indemnity shall not 
be available with respect to matters arising solely out of an act of 
an Indemnified Party involving a release of Contaminant at, on, in or 
under an affected Facility by such Indemnified Party, or out of the 
gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party. The 
indemnification rights provided by this Section 9.15(b) shall 
constitute the sole indemnity available to Indemnified Parties with 
respect to the matters addressed under this Section.

(c) The Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that in 
the event any investigation, litigation or proceeding is asserted or 
threatened in writing or instituted against it or any Indemnified 
Party, or any Remedial Action is requested of it or any Indemnified 
Party, for which indemnity is available under Section 9.15(b) hereof 
and the Administrative Agent or any Lender may desire indemnity or 
defense hereunder, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall 
promptly notify the Credit Parties in writing, setting forth a 
description of those elements of which it has knowledge, but any 
failure to so notify the Credit Parties shall not relieve the Credit 
Parties of any of their obligations hereunder, except to the extent 
such failure materially interferes with the ability of the Credit 
Parties to defend the investigation, litigation, proceeding or 
requested Remedial Action. The Credit Parties at the request of the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have the obligation to 
defend against such investigation, litigation or proceeding or 
requested Remedial Action, and the Credit Parties in any event may 
participate in the defense or settlement thereof with legal counsel 
of its choice; provided, however, that the Credit Parties shall not 
be entitled to control the defense described above. The Credit 
Parties shall have the right to participate in such defense, at such 
party's expense, with legal counsel of its choice, and shall 
cooperate with the Credit Parties in the conduct of such defense, 
provided, that so long as no Event of Default is continuing, no 
Indemnified Party shall settle any such investigation, litigation or 
proceeding or requested Remedial Action without the consent of the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Credit Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed. No action taken by legal counsel chosen by the 
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Lender in 
defending against any such investigation, litigation or proceeding or 
requested Remedial Action shall vitiate or impair the obligation of 
the Credit Parties and duty hereunder to indemnify and hold harmless 
the Indemnified Parties. Any and all amounts payable by the Credit 
Parties (or any of them) as indemnification under this Section 
9.15(d), together with interest thereon at the rate set forth in 
Section 2.6(b) hereof (and, if applicable, Section 2.6(c) hereof), 
shall be due and payable upon receipt of Written Notice to the Credit 
Parties and, until paid, shall be added to the Lender Debt. 

(d) In the event of any Adverse Environmental Condition 
affecting any Facilities, whether or not the same originates or 
emanates from such Facilities or any contiguous real estate, and if 
any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof shall fail to remedy such 
condition in a manner that complies in all respects with any of the 
material requirements of the applicable Environmental Laws, or, in 
the case of a leasehold, if required to do so under the applicable 
lease, the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the Majority 
Lenders) may, but shall not be obligated to, cause such work to be 
performed or take actions reasonably necessary to remedy such Adverse 
Environmental Condition or cure such failure to comply after 
providing Written Notice to the Credit Parties of an intent to do so, 
allowing a reasonable time after receipt of such notice for the 
Credit Parties to cure such failure and in no event less than 60 
days; provided, however, that such work or action shall not interfere 
unreasonably with such Credit Party or Subsidiary. Any amounts paid 
by the Administrative Agent as a result thereof, together with 
interest thereon at the rate set forth in Section 2.6(b) hereof (and, 
if applicable, Section 2.6(c) hereof), shall be immediately due and 
payable by the Credit Parties and, until paid, shall be added to the 
Lender Debt. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as 
limiting or impeding the rights or obligations of any of the Credit 
Parties to take any and all actions necessary or desirable to remedy 
any Adverse Environmental Condition. Any partial exercise by the 
Administrative Agent of the remedies hereinabove set forth or any 
partial undertaking on the part of the Administrative Agent to cure 
any Credit Party's failure or the failure of any Subsidiary thereof 
to comply with the Environmental Laws, shall not obligate the 
Administrative Agent to complete the actions taken or require the 
Administrative Agent to expend further sums to cure noncompliance by 
any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof; neither shall the 
exercise of any such remedy operate to place upon the Administrative 
Agent or any Lender any additional responsibility for the operation, 
control, care, management or repair of the Real Estate or make the 
Administrative Agent or any Lender the "owner" or "operator" of the 
Real Estate or "owner" or "generator" of Contaminants within the 
meaning of the Environmental Laws.

(e) If an Event of Default occurs as the result of any 
Adverse Environmental Condition or Environmental Claim, the 
Administrative Agent (at its option or at the direction of the 
Majority Lenders) in the reasonable exercise of its discretion and 
with reasonable notice under the circumstances, may at any time, and 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
at the sole cost and expense of the Credit Parties (which shall be 
added to the Lender Debt), take such actions and incur such expenses 
as are reasonably necessary to investigate the condition or claim 
involved, including without limitation, to cause one or more 
environmental assessments of the Facilities to be undertaken. 
Environmental assessments may include a detailed visual inspection of 
the Real Estate, including, without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, all storage areas, storage tanks, drains, dry wells, and 
leaching areas, as well as the taking of soil samples, surface water 
samples, and ground water samples, and such other investigation or 
analysis as is reasonably necessary or appropriate for a complete 
assessment of the compliance of the Real Estate and the use and 
operation thereof with all Environmental Laws; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, any 
such inspection and sampling shall be performed by a qualified, and 
if necessary licensed, environmental consultant, retained by Agent 
and PROVIDED FURTHER that no such inspection and sampling shall take 
place on any real property leased to any Credit Party or any of its 
Subsidiaries that requires the consent of the landlord for such 
inspection and sampling without first obtaining such consent (each 
Credit Party agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts to 
obtain such consent); provided, however, that such inspection shall 
not interfere unreasonably with the business operations of such 
Credit Party or Subsidiary. The Credit Parties shall be given the 
opportunity to review and comment upon the scope of work and work 
plan developed by the consultant for the environmental assessment 
prior to such assessment; provided that such review and comments 
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Administrative 
Agent shall give the Credit Parties ten (10) Business Days' advance 
notice that the consultant intends to enter the Real Estate for the 
purpose of conducting an environmental assessment. A representative 
of the Credit Parties shall have the right to accompany the 
consultant as the consultant performs any portion of the 
environmental assessment, provided such representative is reasonably 
available, and the consultant shall provide split samples to the 
representative of the Credit Parties upon request. The consultant 
shall take all reasonable measures to restore the property to the 
condition in which the property was found prior to the environmental 
assessment.

The Administrative Agent promptly shall provide the 
Borrowers with a copy of any reports (including draft reports) and 
analytical data prepared or gathered by the consultant relating to 
the environmental assessment of the Real Estate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, 
that with respect to any such reports and other data provided by the 
Administrative Agent to the Borrowers: (i) the Administrative Agent 
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy thereof, and 
shall not be liable for any information or lack of information 
(including, without limitation, errors or omissions) contained 
therein; (ii) the Borrowers expressly disclaim any reliance upon (A) 
any information contained therein or (B) the Administrative Agent's 
selection of any consultant(s) preparing such reports; and (iii) 
without limiting the generality of any other indemnification 
provision contained in this Section 9.15, the Borrowers agree to pay 
and protect, and defend, indemnify and hold the Administrative 
harmless from and against, any claims, damages, actions, suits, 
proceedings, costs, expenses and other amounts (including, without 
limitation, the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent's outside and in-house counsel) incurred by the 
Administrative Agent as a result of the any Credit Party's or any 
other party's reliance upon any information contained therein or the 
selection of the consultant(s) preparing such reports.

(f) Each Credit Party shall, and shall cause each of its 
Subsidiaries to, without regard to whether any such Person is in 
default, and at such party's sole cost and expense, cause one or more 
"phase I" environmental assessments to be undertaken by an 
environmental consultant satisfactory to the Administrative Agent 
(and in any event, in form and substance sufficient to entitle the 
Administrative Agent and the Lenders to an exemption under any 
applicable state or federal law for lenders or financial institutions 
holding a lien or security interest) before any such party shall (i) 
enter into a contract for the purchase of any real property or (ii) 
enter into any lease with a term in excess of one year; PROVIDED, 
HOWEVER, that no such "phase I" environmental assessments shall be 
required prior to entry into a lease of real property to be used 
solely for retail or office purposes. If any such "phase I" 
environmental assessment shall identify any Adverse Environmental 
Condition or Environmental Claim with respect to such real property, 
such party shall refrain from entering into such contract or lease, 
as the case may be, unless such party shall ensure to the 
satisfaction of the Administrative Agent that such further Remedial 
Action as any Lender may reasonably request is undertaken at the sole 
expense of such party or a third party.

9.16 FINANCIAL COVENANTS. 

(a) EBITDA. The Credit Parties shall cause EBITDA to be,

rendered against a Credit Party or any Credit Party enters into any 
settlement of any lawsuit in which it is a defendant as to any claim 
or counterclaim (the date such judgment is rendered or settlement 
entered into, the "Retest Date"), and any portion of such judgment or 
settlement is not covered by insurance or the insurer has denied 
coverage for any portion thereof (each, an "Uninsured Amount"), then, 
effective as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending on or most 
recently preceding the Retest Date, EBITDA for the period of four 
consecutive fiscal quarters ending on such last day of such fiscal 
quarter shall be reduced by the Uninsured Amount and (i) the Credit 
Parties shall be required to satisfy on the Retest Date the covenants 
contained in Section 9.16(a) and 9.16(b) of this Agreement as though 
such period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, as adjusted by this 
Section 9.16(c), ended on the Retest Date and any failure so to 
satisfy each such covenant on the Retest Date shall be an Event of 
Default hereunder, and (ii) if such reduction shall result in EBITDA 
for such period of four consecutive fiscal quarters being less than 
$40,000,000, then, effective on the Retest Date, the EBITDA Test for 
such period shall be deemed, for the purposes of Section 4.1(b) of 
this Agreement, as not having been met for such period, and any 
payment under Section 4.1(b)(ii) which may become payable as a result 
of such EBITDA Test not having been met shall be immediately due and 
payable.

9.17 LEASES; NEW REAL ESTATE. Upon the request of any 
Agent or any Lender each Credit Party shall provide, and shall cause 
each of its Subsidiaries to provide, the Administrative Agent with 
copies of all leases of real property or similar agreements (and all 
amendments thereto) to which such Credit Party or such Subsidiary is 
a party, whether as lessor or lessee. Each Credit Party shall comply 
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply in all material 
respects with all of its and their obligations under all Leases now 
existing or hereafter entered into by it or them with respect to real 
property including, without limitation, the Master Sublease and all 
Leases listed on Schedule 12.5 hereto. Each Credit Party shall, and 
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide the 
Administrative Agent with a copy of each notice of any payment 
default or other material default received by such Credit Party or

<PAGE>

such Subsidiary under any such lease immediately upon receipt of any 
such notice; (ii) notify each Agent promptly after it opens any new 
Facility; and (iii) use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain and 
deliver to the Agents a Lien Waiver Certificate with respect to any 
new lease.

9.18 SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE. From time to time as may 
be necessary (in the event that such information is not otherwise 
delivered by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders pursuant to this Agreement), the Borrowers will promptly 
supplement or amend each Schedule or representation herein with 
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing or 
occurring at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to 
be set forth or described in such Schedule or as an exception to such 
representation or which is necessary to correct any information in 
such Schedule or representation which has been rendered inaccurate 
thereby in any material respect. No such supplement shall cure any 
Default arising from any misrepresentation being corrected, unless 
such supplement has been approved by the Majority Lenders.

9.19 AGREEMENTS. Each Credit Party shall, and shall 
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, perform, within all required time 
periods (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), all of 
its obligations and enforce all of its rights under each agreement to 
which it is a party, including, without limitation, any leases to 
which any such Credit Party is a party, where the failure to so 
perform and enforce could reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect. No Credit Party shall, or shall suffer or permit any 
of its Subsidiaries to, enter into, or terminate or modify in any 
manner adverse to any such Person, any agreement if the effect 
thereof could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect.

9.20 COLLECTION AND PAYMENT; BANK ACCOUNTS. (a) Each 
Credit Party shall use its best efforts to enter into and cause each 
of its Subsidiaries to enter into blocked account agreements in form 
and substance satisfactory to the Agents (with such modifications as 
are acceptable to the Agents and as amended, modified or supplemented 
from time to time, each a "Blocked Account Agreement") with respect 
to Collection Accounts of such Credit Party or Subsidiary with any of 
such Credit Party's or Subsidiary's major depositary banks. 

(b) Each Credit Party shall establish on or prior to the 
Closing Date and shall at all times thereafter maintain a

another financial institution acceptable to the Agents and shall 
deliver to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date 
with respect to a Concentration Account, a concentration account 
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents (with such

or supplemented from time to time, each a "Concentration Account 
Agreement").

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(c) Each Credit Party shall deposit into a Collection 
Account maintained by such Credit Party all payments and proceeds 
received or derived from or in connection with the operations and 
business of such Credit Party, together with all other payments 
constituting proceeds of any assets, including real or personal 
property now owned or hereafter acquired by such Credit Party, and 
all other proceeds, payments and other amounts received by such 
Credit Party from any source whatsoever ("Proceeds"), in the 
identical form received, whether in cash or by check or otherwise. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, each Borrower shall be 
entitled to maintain up to $20,000 in cash in the aggregate at each 
store operated by such Borrower (or the respective operating bank 
accounts for each such store).

(d) All funds, deposits, earnings and claims in respect 
thereof in the Blocked Accounts and Concentration Accounts shall be 
owned by the Administrative Agent as the sole and exclusive property 
of the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Agents and the 
ratable benefit of the Lenders), subject to the sole dominion and 
control of the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 2.19(b) hereof, and the applicable Blocked 
Account Agreements and Concentration Account Agreements.

(e) Subject to the last sentence of Section 9.20(c) hereof, 
each Credit Party shall instruct each bank that maintains a 
Collection Account (excluding any Concentration Account) for such 
Credit Party to transfer, prior to the close of business on any 
Business Day on which Proceeds are received by such bank, such 
Proceeds (to the extent collected in good funds) to such Credit 
Party's Concentration Account (in accordance with the terms of the 
applicable Blocked Account Agreement if such Collection Account is a 
Blocked Account). Each Credit Party shall instruct each bank that 
maintains a Concentration Account to transfer, prior to the close of

bank, such Proceeds (to the extent collected in good funds) to the 
Payment Account (in accordance with the terms of the applicable 
Concentration Account Agreement).

(f) Promptly upon the Administrative Agent's demand, the 
Borrowers shall (i) pay to the Administrative Agent all fees, costs 
and expenses which the Administrative Agent pays or incurs in 
connection with maintaining or opening the Blocked Accounts or the 
Concentration Accounts, collecting and depositing for collection all 
checks and items of payment received or delivered to any bank for 
deposit in the Blocked Accounts or the Concentration Accounts and 
(ii) shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for all amounts which 
the Administrative Agent may pay to any such bank arising from 
obligations undertaken by the Administrative Agent under any Blocked 
Account Agreement or any Concentration Account Agreement.

(g) Each Credit Party shall use its best efforts to cause 
all payments in respect of its credit card receivables to be 
deposited directly into such Credit Party's Concentration Account or 
the Payment Account.

SECTION 10. NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

The Credit Parties covenant and agree that, so long as any 
Lender Debt is outstanding or any Lender has any Revolving Commitment 
hereunder, the Credit Parties shall not, and shall not suffer or 
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, without the prior 
written consent of the Majority Lenders:

10.1. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. Make Capital Expenditures in 
any Fiscal Year in an aggregate amount for Ames and its Subsidiaries 
in excess of $25,000,000 for any Fiscal Year; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that 
the maximum aggregate amount of Capital Expenditures permitted to be 
made by Ames and its Subsidiaries in any Fiscal Year shall be 
increased (but not decreased),

Cash Proceeds received by the Credit Parties during such Fiscal Year 
as a result of sales of property (to the extent such sales are 
permitted pursuant to Section 10.5(b) or 10.5(c) hereof) to the 
extent such Net Cash Proceeds are applied to Capital Expenditures of 
the Borrowers during such Fiscal Year PLUS (B) amounts received by 
one or more Credit Parties during such Fiscal Year after distribution

(ii) with respect to Fiscal Year 1996, by the sum of (A) 
Excess EBITDA for Fiscal Year 1996 PLUS (B) the amount by which the

and otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to 
foreclose the Liens granted herein or in any of the Security

11.2. SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT. In case any one or more 
Events of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative

the Lenders may proceed to protect and enforce their rights or 
remedies either by suit in equity or by action at law, or both, 
whether for the specific performance of any covenant, agreement or 
other provision contained herein or in any document or instrument 
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document, or to enforce the payment of the Lender Debt or 
any other legal or equitable right or remedy.

11.3 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No right or remedy 
herein conferred upon the Lenders, any Issuing Bank or the 
Administrative Agent is intended to be exclusive of any other right 
or remedy contained herein or in any instrument or document delivered 
in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document, and every such right or remedy shall be cumulative and 
shall be in addition to every other such right or remedy contained 
herein and therein or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity 
or by statute, or otherwise.

11.4. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES NOT WAIVED. To the maximum 
extent permitted by applicable law, no course of dealing between any 
of the Credit Parties and any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any of the 
Agents or any failure or delay on the part of any Lender, any Issuing 
Bank or any of the Agents in exercising any rights or remedies 
hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of the 
Lenders, any Issuing Bank or any of the Agents and no single or 
partial exercise of any rights or remedies hereunder shall operate as 
a waiver or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies 
hereunder or of the same right or remedy on a future occasion.

11.5 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. After the occurrence of an 
Event of Default and acceleration of the Lender Debt as herein 
provided, the proceeds of the Collateral and of property of Persons 
other than the Credit Parties securing the Lender Debt and

Agent to payment of the Lender Debt in the following order, unless a 
court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise direct:

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(i) FIRST, to payment of all costs and expenses of the 
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Lenders 
incurred in connection with the preservation, collection and 
enforcement of the Lender Debt or any Guaranties, or of any of 
the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the 
Security Documents or otherwise, including, without limitation, 
any amounts advanced by the Administrative Agent or any Lenders 
to protect or preserve the Collateral;

(ii) SECOND, to payment of that portion of the Lender 
Debt constituting accrued and unpaid interest and fees and 
indemnities payable under Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof, ratably 
amongst the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the 
Lenders in accordance with the proportion which the accrued 
interest and fees and indemnities payable under Sections 2, 3 and 
4 hereof constituting the Lender Debt owing to the Administrative 
Agent, each Issuing Lender and each such Lender at such time 
bears to the aggregate amount of accrued interest and fees and 
indemnities payable under Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof constituting 
the Lender Debt owing to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing 
Lender and all of the Lenders at such time until such interest, 
fees and indemnities shall be paid in full;

(iii) THIRD, to the Administrative Agent in an amount 
equal to the then aggregate contingent Letter of Credit 
Obligations (to the extent that such obligations exceed Letter of 
Credit Cash Collateral securing the payment of same) to be held 
by the Administrative Agent for the payment of such Letter of 
Credit Obligations when and if due and payable;

(iv) FOURTH, to payment of the principal of the Lender 
Debt (which shall exclude all contingent Letter of Credit 
Obligations and shall include all the other unpaid Letter of 
Credit Obligations), ratably amongst the Lenders and each Issuing 
Lender in accordance with the proportion which the principal 
amount of such Lender Debt owing to each such Lender and Issuing 
Lender bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Lender 
Debt owing to all of such Lenders and Issuing Lenders until such 
principal of such Lender Debt shall be paid in full;

(v) FIFTH, to the payment of all other Lender Debt, 
ratably amongst the Lenders in accordance with the proportion 
which the amount of such other Lender Debt owing to each such 
Lender bears to the aggregate principal amount of such other 
Lender Debt owing to all of the Lenders until such other Lender 
Debt shall be paid in full; and

(vi) SIXTH, the balance, if any, after all of the Lender 
Debt has been satisfied, shall, except as otherwise provided in 
the Security Documents, be deposited by the Administrative Agent 
in an account designated by the Borrowers, or paid over to such 
other Person or Persons as may be required by law.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
In the event that the amount of monies received by the 
Administrative Agent under clause (iii) above with respect to a 
Letter of Credit for which there are contingent Letter of Credit 
Obligations at the time of the Administrative Agent's receipt of such 
monies shall, together with any Letter of Credit Cash Collateral 
securing such contingent Letter of Credit Obligations which is not 
securing other Lenders Debt, exceed the amount of actual payments the 
applicable Issuing Bank shall have made with respect to such Letter 
of Credit after the Administrative Agent's receipt of such monies, 
which determination shall be made after such Letter of Credit has 
been terminated or has expired, then the Administrative Agent shall 
apply such excess monies and Letter of Credit Cash Collateral in 
accordance with this Section 11.5.

SECTION 12. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

Each of the Credit Parties hereby represents and warrants as 
follows (which representations and warranties shall survive the 
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of each 
Revolving Advance and shall be deemed to be incorporated in each 
Borrower's Certificate submitted to the Administrative Agent pursuant 
to Section 2.4 hereof, and shall be deemed repeated and confirmed 
with respect to, and as of the date of, each borrowing hereunder 
(whether requested by any Borrower or deemed requested by any 
Borrower) and of each issuance of a Letter of Credit):

12.1. CORPORATE AND PARTNERSHIP STATUS. (a) Each Credit 
Party is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or 
partnership, as the case may be, in good standing under the laws of 
the state of its incorporation or organization with perpetual 
corporate or partnership existence, as the case may be. Each Credit 
Party has the corporate or partnership power and authority, as the 
case may be, to own its properties and to transact the business in 
which it is engaged or presently proposes to engage.

(b) Each Credit Party is qualified as a foreign corporation 
or partnership, as the case may be, and in good standing in each 
other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property of a nature, 
or transacts business of a type, that would make such qualification 
necessary, except where the failure to so qualify could not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The capital stock or partnership interests, as the case 
may be, of each Credit Party is owned as set forth on Schedule 12.1 
hereto free and clear of all Liens, except in favor of the 
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Agents and the ratable 
benefit of the Lenders.

(d) None of the Credit Parties has any Subsidiaries except

the corporate or partnership power and authority, as the case may be, 
to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and all 
instruments and documents delivered by it pursuant thereto and hereto 
and each of the Credit Parties has duly taken or caused to be duly 
taken all necessary corporate or partnership action, as the case may 
be, (including, without limitation, the obtaining of any consent of 
stockholders or partners required by law or its certificate of 
incorporation, by-laws or partnership agreement), to authorize the 
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each other 
Loan Document, in each case, to which it is a party, and the 
instruments and documents delivered by it pursuant thereto and 
hereto. Each of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and each of 
the other instruments and documents executed and delivered by any of 
the Credit Parties pursuant hereto and thereto to which it is a party 
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person, and

enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, 
moratorium and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of 
creditors' rights generally and by general equity principles.

12.3 NO VIOLATION OF AGREEMENTS. None of the Credit 
Parties is in violation of any provision of its certificate or 
articles of incorporation or its by-laws or its partnership 
agreement, as the case may be, or is in default under any indenture, 
mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other instrument to which any 
of them is a party or by which any of them may be bound, which 
default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 
Effect. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the 
other Loan Documents or any of the instruments and documents to be 
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, the consummation of the 
transactions herein and therein contemplated nor the compliance with 
any of the provisions hereof or thereof, will violate any provision 
of the certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws or 
partnership agreement, as the case may be, of any Credit Party or any 
law or regulation, or any order or decree of any court or 
governmental instrumentality, or will (i) conflict with, or result in 
the breach of, or constitute a default or permit termination under, 
any lease, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other 
instrument to which any Credit Party is a party or by which any of 
them or their respective properties may be bound, or (ii) except for 
Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the 
Lenders, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any 
property of any Credit Party.

12.4. NO LITIGATION. (a) Except as set forth in 
Schedule 12.4 hereto, there are no actions, suits or proceedings 
pending, or, to the best knowledge of any Borrower threatened, 
against any of the Credit Parties or any of their respective 
Subsidiaries before any court, arbitrator or governmental or 
administrative body or agency which challenge the validity or 
propriety of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, the 
other Loan Documents or the documents, instruments and agreements 
executed or delivered in connection herewith, therewith or related 
thereto, or which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(b) No Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof is in default 
under any applicable statute, rule, order, decree or regulation of 
any court, arbitrator or governmental body or agency having 
jurisdiction over such Credit Party or Subsidiary, which default

restraint with respect to any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof 
exists which prohibits any of the other transactions contemplated 
hereby or in connection therewith or herewith.

(viii) the Credit Parties or their respective 
Subsidiaries have all the right, title and interest of the lessee

them as lessee under each such lease to the extent not subleased;

of the transactions contemplated hereby; no event has occurred 
which (with the giving of notice or passage of time or both) 
would impair any right of such party to exercise and obtain the 
benefits of any options contained in any such lease; and there is 
no default under or any reasonable basis for acceleration or 
termination of, nor has any event occurred which (with the giving 
of notice or passage of time or both) would constitute a default

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and

(ix) municipal water service, storm sewer, sanitary 
sewer facilities, and telephone, electric and gas service are

12.6. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CONDITION. (a) Each of 
the Financial Statements presents fairly in accordance with GAAP (i) 
the financial position of Ames and its Subsidiaries as of the date of 
such financial statements and (ii) the results of operations of Ames 
and its Subsidiaries for such period. Neither Ames nor any of its 
Subsidiaries had any direct or indirect material contingent 
liabilities as of the date of the Financial Statements which are not 
reserved for therein or which in accordance with GAAP would have to 
be included in footnotes thereto. Each of the Financial Statements 
has been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis 
consistently maintained throughout the period involved (except as 
otherwise described therein). There has been no material adverse 
change in the business, operations, liabilities, assets, properties, 
prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of Ames and its 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, since the Reference Date.

(b) Each Agent and each Lender has been furnished 
projections, dated March 14, 1994 attached hereto as Exhibit 12.6(b) 
hereto, (as the same may be supplemented or amended as required by, 
and with the approval of, the Lenders, the "Projections") as to the 
future performance of Ames and its Subsidiaries. No fact is known to 
any Credit Party as of the Closing Date which would have a material 
adverse effect on the business, operations, liabilities, assets, 
properties, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of Ames 
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that has not been set forth 
in the financial statements referred to in this Section 12.6 or 
disclosed herein or otherwise disclosed to the Administrative Agent 
in writing prior to the Closing Date. The Projections are based upon 
reasonable estimates and assumptions, all of which are reasonable in 
light of the conditions which existed at the time the Projections 
were made, have been prepared on the basis of the assumptions stated 
therein, and reflect as of the Closing Date the reasonable estimate 
of Ames of the results of operations and other information projected 
therein, it being recognized that such Projections as to future 
events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during 
the period or periods covered by such Projections may differ 
materially from the Projections.

(c) Pursuant to Section 6.2 of this Agreement, each Agent 
and each Lender has been furnished with a pro forma balance sheet of 
Ames and its Subsidiaries taking into account all transactions 
contemplated hereby. As of the Closing Date, neither Ames nor any of 
its Subsidiaries has any material liabilities, contingent or 
otherwise, which are not referred to in such balance sheet or in the 
notes thereto and which are required to be disclosed therein in 
accordance with GAAP.

(d) As of the Closing Date, there has been no material 
adverse change in the level of vendor and trade support for Ames and 
its Subsidiaries.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
12.7. TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, ETC. Each of the Credit 
Parties owns or possesses all the trademarks, trade names, 
copyrights, patents, licenses or rights in any thereof adequate for 
the conduct of its business, without, to the best of its knowledge, 
conflict with the rights or claimed rights of others.

12.8. TAX LIABILITY. All federal income tax returns 
required to be filed by Ames and its Subsidiaries (and each Affiliate 
with which Ames or its Subsidiaries files consolidated, combined or 
unitary returns) and all other material tax returns, reports and 
statements, domestic or foreign, have been filed with the appropriate 
governmental agencies in all jurisdictions in which such returns, 
reports and statements are required to be filed, and all Charges and 
other impositions shown thereon to be due and payable have been paid 
prior to the date on which any fine, penalty, interest, late charge 
or loss may be added thereto for nonpayment thereof, or any such 
fine, penalty, interest, late charge or loss has been paid or 
adequate reserves have been established in respect thereof in 
accordance with GAAP. Each of Ames and its Subsidiaries (and each 
such Affiliate) has paid when due and payable all material Charges 
required to be paid by it. Proper and accurate amounts have been 
withheld by Ames and its Subsidiaries (and each such Affiliate) from 
their respective employees for all periods in full and complete 
compliance with the tax, social security and unemployment withholding 
provisions of applicable federal, state, local and foreign law and 
such withholdings have been timely paid to the respective 
governmental agencies. Schedule 12.8 sets forth, for each of Ames 
and its Subsidiaries (and each such Affiliate), those taxable years 
for which its tax returns have been within the twelve (12) month 
period preceding the Closing Date or are being audited as of the date 
hereof by the Internal Revenue Service or, in the case of any 
material Tax, any other applicable governmental authority. No issue 
has been raised in writing or, if not in writing, to any Credit 
Party's knowledge in any such examination that, by application of 
similar principles, reasonably may be expected to result in assertion 
of a material deficiency for any other taxable year not so examined 
that has not been accrued on the Financial Statements that would be 
required to be so accrued in accordance with GAAP. Except as 
described on Schedule 12.8 hereto, neither Ames nor any of its 
Subsidiaries has, as of the date hereof, executed or filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service or, to its knowledge, any other governmental 
authority any agreement or other document extending, or having the 
effect of extending, the period for assessment or collection of any 
Charges. Neither Ames nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or has 
been requested to make any adjustment under Code Section 481(a) by 
reason of a change in accounting method initiated by Ames or any of 
its Subsidiaries. Except as described on Schedule 12.8 hereto, 
neither Ames nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation under any 
tax sharing agreement.

12.9 GOVERNMENTAL ACTION. No action of, or filing with, 
any governmental or public body or authority (other than normal 
reporting requirements or filing as to Collateral under the 
provisions of Section 5 hereof) is required to authorize, or is 
otherwise required in connection with, the execution, delivery or

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
the Notes, the other Loan Documents or any of the instruments or 
documents to be delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, except such as 
have been made or will be made as contemplated by such agreements.

12.10. DISCLOSURE. Neither the Schedules hereto, nor the 
Financial Statements, nor the certificates, statements, reports or 
other documents furnished to any Lender or the Administrative Agent 
by or on behalf of any of the Credit Parties in connection herewith 
or in connection with any transaction contemplated hereby, nor this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document, contains, at the time 
furnished, any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state 
any material fact (known to any such Person in the case of any docu-
ment not furnished by it) necessary in order to make the statements 
contained herein or therein not misleading in light of the 
circumstances in which the same were made.

12.11 FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS; SECURITIES LAWS. None 
of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries owns 
any "margin stock" as such term is defined in Regulation U, as 
amended (12 C.F.R. Part 221), of the Board. The proceeds of the 
borrowings made hereunder will be used only for the purposes set 
forth in Section 8 hereof. None of the proceeds will be used, 
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any 
margin stock or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any 
Indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry 
margin stock or for any other purpose which might constitute the 
Loans under this Agreement a "purpose credit" within the meaning of 
said Regulation U or Regulation X (12 C.F.R. Part 224) of the Board. 
None of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or 
any agent acting in its behalf has taken or will take any action 
which might cause this Agreement or any of the documents or 
instruments delivered pursuant hereto to violate any regulation of 
the Board (including, without limitation, Regulation G, T, U or X 
thereof) or to violate the Exchange Act or any applicable state 
securities laws.

12.12. INVESTMENT COMPANY. None of the Credit Parties or 
any of their respective Subsidiaries is an "investment company," or 
an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" 
for, an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1, ET 
SEQ.). None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents shall violate the Investment Company Act of 
1940, as amended.

12.13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Neither any Credit Party 
nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or contributes to any Employee Plan 
or any Multiemployer Plan other than those listed on Schedule 12.13 
hereto. Each Employee Plan of any Credit Party or any ERISA 
Affiliate, which is not a Multiemployer Plan and which is intended to 
be tax qualified under Code Section 401(a) has been determined by the 
Internal Revenue Service to qualify under Code Section 401, and the 
trusts created thereunder have been determined to be exempt from tax 
under the provisions of Code Section 501. Nothing has occurred which 
would cause the loss of such qualification or the imposition of any 
Code or ERISA material tax liability or penalty to any Credit Party,

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
or any ERISA Affiliate. With respect to each Employee Plan, all 
reports required under ERISA or any other applicable law or 
regulation to be filed by any Credit Party or any ERISA Affiliate 
with the relevant governmental authority have been duly filed and all 
such reports are true and correct in all material respects as of the 
date given. Neither any Credit Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has 
engaged in a "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in 
Code Section 4975 and Title I of ERISA, in connection with any 
Employee Plan which would subject any Credit Party or any ERISA 
Affiliate (after giving effect to any exemption) to a material tax or 
penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Code Section 4975 or 
Section 502 of ERISA. No Pension Benefit Plan has incurred an ERISA 
Event, nor has any accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Code 
Section 412(a)) been incurred, nor has any funding waiver from the 
Internal Revenue Service been received or requested with respect to 
any Pension Benefit Plan. The value of the assets of each Pension 
Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA equalled or exceeded the 
present value of the "benefit liabilities," as defined in Title IV of 
ERISA of each such Plan as of the end of the preceding plan year 
using Plan actuarial assumptions as in effect for such plan year. 
The funding methods used in connection with each Pension Benefit Plan 
are acceptable under ERISA and the actuarial assumptions and methods 
used in connection with such funding are reasonable. There are no 
claims (other than claims for benefits in the normal course), actions 
or lawsuits asserted or instituted against, and neither any Credit 
Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has knowledge of any threatened 
litigation or claims against (i) the assets of any Pension Benefit 
Plan or against any fiduciary of such Plan with respect to the 
operation of such Plan or (ii) the assets of any employee welfare 
benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(l) or against any 
fiduciary thereof with respect to the operation of any such plan. 
Neither any Credit Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred (a) any 
liability to the PBGC (other than routine claims and premium 
payments), (b) any withdrawal liability (and no event has occurred 
which, with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would 
result in such liability) under Section 4201 of ERISA as a result of 
a complete or partial withdrawal (within the meaning of Section 4203 
or 4205 of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or (c) any liability 
under ERISA Section 4062 to the PBGC, or to a trustee appointed under 
ERISA Section 4042. No Credit Party or ERISA Affiliate has been 
notified or otherwise has knowledge that any Multiemployer Plan is 
insolvent or in reorganization within the meanings of Sections 4245 
and 4241 of ERISA. Neither any Credit Party nor any ERISA Affiliate 
nor any organization to which any Credit Party or any such ERISA 
Affiliate is a successor or parent corporation within the meaning of 
ERISA Section 4069(b) has engaged in a transaction within the meaning 
of ERISA Section 4069. Neither any Credit Party nor any ERISA 
Affiliate maintains an established welfare benefit plan within the 
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, other than those listed on Schedule 
12.13 hereto, which provides for continuing benefits or coverage for 
any participant or any beneficiary of a participant after such 
participant's termination of employment except as may be required by 
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as 
amended ("COBRA"), and the regulations thereunder or by applicable 
state statutory law. Each Credit Party and each ERISA Affiliate

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
maintaining a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) 
of ERISA has complied with the notice and continuation coverage 
requirements of COBRA and the regulations thereunder so as not to 
result in any material loss of deduction under Section 162 of the 
Code or any material tax, penalty or liability to any such Credit 
Party or any such ERISA Affiliate.

12.14. PERMITS, LAWS, ETC. (a) Each Credit Party and 
each Subsidiary thereof possesses all material permits, licenses, 
approvals and consents of Federal, state and local governments and 
regulatory authorities required to conduct properly its business as 
presently conducted and proposed to be conducted;

(b) Each such permit, license, approval and consent is and 
will be in full force and effect, and no event has occurred which 
permits the revocation or termination of any such permit, license, 
approval or consent or the imposition of any restriction thereon of 
such nature as may materially limit the operation of the business 
covered thereby;

(c) All approvals, applications, filings, registrations, 
consents or other actions required of any local, state or Federal 
authority to enable each Credit Party and its Subsidiaries to use any 
such permit, license, approval or consent has been obtained or made;

(d) Neither any Credit Party nor any Subsidiary of any 
Credit Party (i) is in violation of any governmental, environmental, 
labor, ERISA or other regulation, rule or law or any duty or 
obligation required by law or any regulation, rule or law applicable 
to the operation of any of its businesses, or (ii) has received any 
Written Notice from the granting body or any other governmental 
authority with respect to any material breach of any covenant under, 
or any material default with respect to, any such permit, license, 
approval or consent; 

(e) Immediately before and upon giving effect to this 
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, no material 
default shall have occurred and be continuing under any such permit, 
license, approval or consent;

(f) All consents and approvals of, filings and 
registrations with, and all other actions in respect of, all 
governmental agencies, authorities or instrumentalities required to 
maintain any such permit, license, approval or consent in full force 
and effect prior to the scheduled date of expiration thereof has 
been, or, prior to the time when required, will have been, obtained, 
given, filed or taken and are or will be in full force and effect; 

(g) There is not pending or, to the knowledge of any 
Borrower, threatened, any action to revoke, cancel, suspend, modify 
or refuse to renew any such permit, license, approval or consent and 
each business covered by each such permit, license, approval or 
consent is being operated in substantial compliance with such permit, 
license, approval or consent;

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(h) There is not now issued or outstanding or, to the 
knowledge of any Borrower, threatened any notice of any hearing, 
violation or complaint against such Credit Party or Subsidiary 
thereof with respect to any such permit, license, approval or consent 
and no Credit Party or Subsidiary thereof has any knowledge that any 
Person intends to contest the renewal of any such permit, license, 
approval or consent; 

and in the case of clauses (a) through (h) of this Section 12.14, the 
breach of which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material 
Adverse Effect.

12.15. ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS. Except as disclosed on 
Schedule 12.15 hereto (i) the operations of each of the Credit 
Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries comply in all 
material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) each 
of the Credit Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries have 
obtained all material environmental, health and safety Permits 
necessary for their operation, and all such Permits are valid, and in 
good standing and each of the Credit Parties and each of their 
respective Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects 
with all terms and conditions of such Permits; (iii) each of the 
Credit Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries and all of

authority or private party respecting (a) any Environmental Laws, (b) 
any Remedial Action, or (c) any Environmental Claims arising from the 
Release of a Contaminant into the environment; (iv) none of the

into the environment; (vi) neither any Credit Party nor any 
Subsidiary thereof or to the knowledge of the Credit Parties any 
predecessor of any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof has filed 
any notice under Federal or state law indicating past or present 
treatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste or reporting a 
spill or Release of a Contaminant into the environment where such 
treatment, storage and disposal would result in a material liability; 
(vii) to the best of the knowledge of the Borrowers, neither any 
Credit Party nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has any

Contaminant into the environment; (viii) none of the Credit Parties' 
or any of their respective Subsidiaries' operations involve the 
generation, transportation, treatment or disposal of hazardous waste, 
as defined under 40 C.F.R. Parts 260-270 or any state equivalent, 
other than in material compliance with Environmental Law; (ix)

and warranties shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of 
this Agreement until such time as the environmental indemnity 
referred to in Section 9.15 hereof is terminated.

satisfactory indemnification is provided) and this Agreement is 
terminated, the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent shall 
terminate. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(e) All representations, warranties, covenants, waivers and 
agreements contained herein shall survive termination hereof unless 
otherwise provided. 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after receipt of any 
payment of all or any part of the Lender Debt, any of the Agents, any 
Issuing Lender or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender 
such payment to any Person or entity because such payment is deter-
mined to be void or voidable as a preference, an impermissible 
set-off, a diversion of trust funds or for any other reason, this 
Agreement shall continue in full force, and the Credit Parties, as 
appropriate, shall be liable to, and shall indemnify and hold such 
Lender, such Issuing Lender or such Agent, as the case may be, 
harmless for, the amount of such payment surrendered until such 
Lender, such Issuing Lender or such Agent, as the case may be, shall 
have been finally and irrevocably paid in full. The provisions of 
the foregoing sentence shall be and remain effective notwithstanding 
any contrary action which may have been taken by the Lenders, such 
Issuing Lender or such Agent in reliance upon such payment, and any 
such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the 
Lenders', such Issuing Lender's or such Agent's rights under this 
Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such 
payment having become final and irrevocable.

(g) All indemnities provided for under this Agreement and 
the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, under 
Sections 2.10 and 13.5 hereof and this Section 13.8, shall survive 
the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the 
Lender Debt.

13.9. CAPTIONS. The captions of the various sections and 
paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted only for the purposes 
of convenience; such captions are not a part of this Agreement and 
shall not be deemed in any manner to modify, explain, enlarge or 
restrict any of the provisions of this Agreement.

13.10 LIEN; SET-OFF BY LENDERS. Each of the Credit 
Parties hereby grants to each Lender, each of the Co-Agents and the 
Administrative Agent a continuing Lien for all Lender Debt upon any 
and all monies, securities and other property of such Credit Party 
and the proceeds thereof, now or hereafter held or received by, or in 
transit to, such Lender, such Co-Agent or the Administrative Agent 
from or for such Credit Party, whether for safekeeping, custody, 
pledge, transmission, collection or otherwise, and also upon any and 
all deposits (general or special) and credits of such Credit Party 
with, and any and all claims of such Credit Party against, any 
Lender, the Co-Agents or the Administrative Agent, at any time 
existing (which shall constitute part of the Collateral). Upon the 
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, without 
regard to the adequacy of any Collateral held as collateral for the 
Lender Debt, each Lender, the each of the Co-Agents and the 
Administrative Agent shall, unless otherwise directed in writing by 
the Majority Lenders, be entitled at any time and from time to time, 
without notice to such Credit Party, to set-off, appropriate and 
apply any or all items hereinabove referred to against all Lender 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Debt in accordance with the Loan Documents (including, without 
limitation, Section 13.13(k) hereof) and neither the Administrative 
Agent nor any Co-Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to 
determine the adequacy of any Collateral in connection with any such 
offset.

13.11 PAYMENT DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAY. Whenever any 
payment to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document or on 
any Advance shall be stated to be due and payable, or whenever the 
last day of any Interest Period would otherwise occur, on a day which 
is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made and the last day of 
such Interest Period shall occur on the next succeeding Business Day 
and such extension of time shall in such case be included in 
computing interest on such payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if such 
extension would cause a payment of a Eurodollar Advance to be made, 
or the last day of such Interest Period for a Eurodollar Advance to 
occur, in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be 
made and the last day of such Interest Period shall occur on the next 
preceding Business Day.

13.12. SERVICE OF PROCESS. Each of the Credit Parties 
hereby irrevocably consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the 
courts of the State of New York and of any Federal Court located in 
the City of New York in connection with any action or proceeding 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Guaranty, any of 
the Security Documents, all or any of the Lender Debt, the 
Collateral, all or any of the Notes, any other Loan Document or any 
document or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement. In any 
such litigation, each of the Credit Parties waives, to the fullest 
extent it may effectively do so, personal service of any summons, 
complaint or other process and agrees that the service thereof may be 
made by certified or registered mail directed to any Credit Party at 
its address set forth in Section 13.4 hereof. Each of the Credit 
Parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do 
so, the defenses of forum non conveniens and improper venue.

13.13. BANKAMERICA BUSINESS CREDIT, INC., AS 
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates 
and appoints BABC as the administrative agent of such Lender under 
each of the Loan Documents in which BABC is named as "Administrative 
Agent", and each such Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes BABC, as 
the administrative agent for such Lender to take such action on 
behalf of each Lender under the provisions of the Loan Documents and 
in the absence of other written instructions of the Majority Lenders 
(or as required by this Agreement all of the Lenders), which 
instructions the Administrative Agent shall follow, and to exercise 
such powers and rights (including, without limitation, the right 
(subject to Section 2.24 hereof) to determine whether any particular 
item of Inventory constitutes Eligible Inventory and whether to 
establish reserves that would have the effect of reducing any 
Borrower's Borrowing Limit) and perform such duties as are expressly 
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan 
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably 
incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
elsewhere in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not 
have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth 
in the Loan Documents, nor any fiduciary relationship with any Lender 
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, 
obligations or liabilities shall be read into the Loan Documents or 
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. 

(b) The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties 
under the Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact 
and shall be entitled to advice of counsel, and other specialists and 
advisors (including affiliates of BABC) selected by it, concerning 
all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent 
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such 
agents, attorneys-in-fact, counsel and other specialists and advisors 
selected by it with reasonable care. 

(c) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or 
affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or 
omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with 
the Loan Documents (except for its or such Person's own gross 
negligence or wilful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner 
to any Lender for any recitals, statements, errors, omissions, 
representations or warranties made by any of the Credit Parties or 
any of their respective Subsidiaries or any officer thereof contained 
in the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or 
other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the 
Administrative Agent under or in connection with the Loan Documents, 
or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, 
enforceability or sufficiency of the Loan Documents or for any 
failure of any of the Credit Parties or any of their respective 
Subsidiaries to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any 
Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance 
of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, the Loan 
Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any of 
the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except 
that the Administrative Agent shall in each Fiscal Year, to the 
extent not otherwise requested by any other Agent, request at least 
one field examination under Section 9.7 hereof and one appraisal 
under Section 9.14 hereof. The Administrative Agent in its capacity 
as such shall not be liable or responsible in any manner to any 
Person for any determinations made or instructions given by any 
Co-Agent pursuant to Section 2.24 hereof.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and 
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, 
resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, 
cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, 
order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to 
be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the 
proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal 
counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Credit 
Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by the 
Administrative Agent.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(e) The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in 
failing or refusing to take any action under the Loan Documents 
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the 
Majority Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be 
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all 
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking 
or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent 
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining 
from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with a request of 
the Majority Lenders (or where required by the terms of this 
Agreement, the Lenders) or, under Section 2.24, a Co-Agent, and such 
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall 
be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

(f) The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have 
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of 
Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent shall have received 
notice from a Lender or one of the Credit Parties referring to this 
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default or stating 
that such notice is a "notice of default." In the event that the 
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent 
shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. Subject to Section 
7.2 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall take such action or 
refrain from taking such action with respect to such Default or Event 
of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders; 
PROVIDED that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have 
received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not 
be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such 
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall 
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

(g) Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the 
Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, 
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations 
or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent 
hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any of the 
Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be 
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the 
Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the 
Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance 
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such 
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own 
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, 
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each 
of the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and made its 
own decision to make its loans and other financial accommodations 
hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents 
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the 
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents 
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to 
make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or 
not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such 
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the 
business, operations, liabilities, assets, properties and condition 
(financial or otherwise) and creditworthiness of each of the Credit 
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries and whether or not such 
Lender should obtain appraisals of any real property Collateral in 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
order to comply with applicable law, it being understood that no such 
appraisals were obtained by the Administrative Agent. Except for 
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be 
furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder and 
for any other written materials received by the Administrative Agent 
from any of the Credit Parties that any Lender has requested the 
Administrative Agent to furnish, the Administrative Agent shall not 
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit 
or other information concerning the business, operations, property, 
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the 
Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries which may come 
into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or 
affiliates.

(h) Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative 
Agent in its capacity as such and the Administrative Agent's 
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-
fact or affiliates (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit 
Parties and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to 
do so), ratably according to the total loan percentages set forth 
opposite its name on Exhibit A hereto from and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, 
judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including the allocated costs and 
expenses of in-house legal counsel) or disbursements of any kind 
whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at any 
time following the payment of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by 
or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to 
or arising out of the Loan Documents, the financing thereunder, or 
any of the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or 
omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any 
of the foregoing; PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for the 
payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, 
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or 
disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross 
negligence or wilful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 
13.13(h) shall survive the payment of the Notes and the Lender Debt.

(i) BABC and its affiliates may make loans to, accept 
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the 
Credit Parties as though BABC were not the Administrative Agent 
hereunder. With respect to its pro rata share of the Advances made 
or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, BABC shall have the same 
rights and powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise 
the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent. The terms 
"Lender" and "Lenders" shall include BABC in its individual capacity.

(j) The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative 
Agent upon 30 days' Written Notice to the Lenders. If the 
Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this 
Agreement, the Majority Lenders shall appoint from among the Agents 
or, with prior consent of the Borrowers (which shall not be withheld 
or delayed unreasonably) any other Lender as successor administrative 
agent for the Lenders. If no successor administrative agent is 
appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the 
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after 
consulting with the Lenders, a successor administrative agent from 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
among the Agents or, with prior consent of the Borrowers (which shall 
not be withheld or delayed unreasonably) any other Lender. Upon the 
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent 
hereunder, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all 
the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent 
and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor 
administrative agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's 
appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be 
terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation 
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 
13.13 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted 
to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this 
Agreement. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall enter 
receivership or a proceeding in bankruptcy shall be commenced by or 
against the Administrative Agent, then Lenders, excluding the Lender 
that is the Administrative Agent, having sixty-six and two-thirds 
percent (66 2/3%) of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, may remove 
the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. BABC may be removed 
as Administrative Agent hereunder by the Majority Lenders in the 
event that it shall acquire any equity interest in or subordinated 
Indebtedness of any Credit Party, unless such equity interest or 
subordinated Indebtedness was acquired by BABC pursuant to an 
offering made to all the Lenders on a pro rata basis. Any removal of 
the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed as a resignation 
for purposes of appointing a successor Administrative Agent.

(k) Each Lender agrees that (i) all obligations of the 
Credit Parties to each Lender under this Agreement and under the 
Notes rank PARI PASSU in all respects with each other, and (ii) if 
any Lender shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, 
set-off, counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment with respect to 
its Revolving Commitment which results in its receiving more than its 
pro rata share of the aggregate payments in respect of the Aggregate 
Revolving Commitments, then (A) such Lender shall be deemed to have 
simultaneously purchased from each of the other Lenders a share in 
its Advances so that the amount of the Advances of all Lenders shall 
be pro rata and (B) such other adjustments shall be made from time to 
time as shall be equitable to insure that all Lenders share such 
payments ratably. If all or any portion of any such excess payment 
is thereafter recovered from the Lender which received the same, the 
purchase provided in this Section 13.13(k) shall be deemed to have 
been rescinded to the extent of such recovery, without interest. 
Each of the Credit Parties expressly consents to the foregoing 
arrangements and agrees that each Lender so purchasing a portion of 
another Lender's loan may exercise all rights of payment (including, 
without limitation, all rights of set-off, banker's lien or 
counterclaim) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender 
were the direct holder of such portion.

(l) The Administrative Agent agrees that it shall promptly, 
and in any event within five (5) Business Days, deliver to each 
Lender copies of all notices, demands, statements and communications 
which the Administrative Agent gives to the Credit Parties, except 
for routine notices of payments due under the Loan Documents and 
other miscellaneous notices, demands, statements and communications, 
which are not material to the interests of any Lender. The 
Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Lender, nor shall 
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
a cause of action arise against the Administrative Agent, as a result 
of the failure of the Administrative Agent to deliver to any Lender 
any such notice, demand, statement or communication.

(m) The Administrative Agent shall endeavor to exercise the 
same care in its administration of the Loan Documents as it exercises 
with respect to similar transactions in which it is involved and 
where no other co-lenders or participants are involved; PROVIDED that 
the liability of the Administrative Agent for failing to do so shall 
be limited as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 
13.13.

(n) (i) If at any time or times it shall be necessary or 
prudent in order to conform to any law of any jurisdiction in 
which any of the Collateral shall be located, or the 
Administrative Agent shall be advised by counsel, that it is so 
necessary or prudent in the interest of the Lenders, or the 
Administrative Agent shall deem it necessary for its own 
protection in the performance of its duties hereunder, the 
Administrative Agent and (to the extent required by the 
Administrative Agent) each Credit Party shall execute and deliver 
all instruments and agreements reasonably necessary or proper to 
constitute another bank or trust company, or one or more 
individuals approved by the Administrative Agent (to the extent 
necessary or requested by the Administrative Agent) (each an 
"Approved Delegate"), either to act as co-agent or co-agents or 
trustee of all or any of the Collateral, jointly with the 
Administrative Agent originally named herein or any successor, or 
to act as separate agent or agents or trustee of any such 
Collateral. In the event that any of the Credit Parties shall 
not have joined in the execution of such instruments or 
agreements with any Approved Delegate within thirty (30) Business 
Days after the receipt of a written request from the 
Administrative Agent to do so, or in case an Event of Default 
shall have occurred and be continuing, each of the Credit Parties 
hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent 
and attorney to act for it under the foregoing provisions of this 
Section 13.13(n) in such contingency.

(ii) Every separate agent and every co-agent and every 
trustee, other than any agent which may be appointed as successor 
to the Administrative Agent, shall, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law, be appointed to act and be such, subject to the 
following provisions and conditions, namely:

(A) except as otherwise provided herein, all rights, 
remedies, powers, duties and obligations conferred upon, 
reserved or imposed upon the Administrative Agent in respect 
of the custody, control and management of moneys, paper or 
securities shall be exercised solely by the Administrative 
Agent hereunder;

(B) all rights, remedies, powers, duties and 
obligations conferred upon, reserved to or imposed upon the 
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conferred, reserved 
or imposed and exercised or performed by the Administrative 
Agent except to the extent that the instrument appointing 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
such separate agent or separate agents or co-agent or 
co-agents or trustee shall otherwise provide, and except to 
the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which 
any particular act or acts are to be performed, the 
Administrative Agent shall be incompetent or unqualified to 
perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, 
remedies, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised 
and performed by such separate agents or co-agent or co- 
agents to the extent specifically directed in writing by the 
Administrative Agent;

(C) no power given hereby to, or which it is provided 
hereby may be exercised by, any such separate agent or 
separate agents or co-agent or co-agents or trustee shall be 
exercised hereunder by such separate agent or separate 
agents or co-agent or co-agents or trustee except jointly 
with, or with the consent in writing of, the Administrative 
Agent, anything herein contained to the contrary 
notwithstanding;

(D) no separate agent or co-agent or trustee 
constituted under this Section 13.13(n) shall be personally 
liable by reason of any act or omission of any other agent, 
separate agent, co-agent or trustee hereunder; and

(E) the Administrative Agent, at any time by an 
instrument in writing, executed by it, may accept the 
resignation of or remove any such separate agent or co-agent 
or trustee, and in that case, by an instrument in writing 
executed by the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties 
(to the extent necessary or requested by the Administrative 
Agent) jointly, may appoint a successor to such separate 
agent or co-agent or trustee, as the case may be, anything 
herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding. In the 
event that any of the Credit Parties shall not have joined 
in the execution of any such instrument with a Person or 
entity within ten (10) days after the receipt of a written 
request from the Administrative Agent to do so, or in the 
case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Administrative Agent, acting alone, may 
appoint a successor and may execute any instrument in 
connection therewith, and the Credit Parties hereby 
irrevocably appoint the Administrative Agent its agent and 
attorney to act for it in such connection in either or such 
contingencies.

(iii) None of the Co-Agents shall be deemed to be an 
Approved Delegate or otherwise a co-agent or trustee for purposes 
of paragraph (ii).

13.14. CO-AGENTS. (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably 
designates and appoints each of GE Capital and Congress as a co-agent 
of such Lender under this Agreement, and each such Lender hereby 
irrevocably authorizes GE Capital and Congress, as co-agents, for 
such Lender to take such action on behalf of each Lender under the 
provisions of this Agreement and in the absence of other written 
instructions of the Majority Lenders (or as required by this 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Agreement all of the Lenders), which instructions the Co-Agents shall 
follow, and to exercise such powers (including, without limitation, 
the right to determine (subject to Section 2.24 hereof) whether any 
particular item of Inventory constitutes Eligible Inventory and 
whether to establish reserves that would have the effect of reducing 
any Borrower's Borrowing Base) and perform such duties as are 
expressly delegated to the Co-Agents by the terms of this Agreement, 
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in the Loan 
Documents, the Co-Agents shall not have any duties or 
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, 
nor any fiduciary relationship with any Lender and no implied 
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or 
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist 
against the Co-Agents. 

(b) Neither any Co-Agent nor any of its officers, 
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall 
be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by 
it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement (except 
for its or such Person's own gross negligence or wilful misconduct), 
or (ii) responsible in any manner to any Lender for any recitals, 
statements, errors, omissions, representations or warranties made by 
any of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or 
any officer thereof contained in the Loan Documents or in any 
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or 
provided for in, or received by any Co-Agent under or in connection 
with this Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, 
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of the Loan Documents or 
for any failure of any of the Credit Parties or any of their 
respective Subsidiaries to perform its obligations under the Loan 
Documents. The Co-Agents shall not be under any obligation to any 
Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance 
of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, the Loan 
Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any of 
the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries. No 
Co-Agent in its capacity as such shall be liable or responsible in 
any manner to any Person for any determinations made by the 
Administrative Agent or by any determinations made or instructions 
given by any other Co-Agent pursuant to Section 2.24 hereof.

(c) Each Co-Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be 
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, 
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, 
telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other 
document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and 
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or 
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, 
without limitation, counsel to the Credit Parties), independent 
accountants and other experts selected by such Co-Agent.

(d) Each Co-Agent shall be fully justified in failing or 
refusing to take any action under the Loan Documents unless it shall 
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as 
it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its 
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take 
any such action. Each Co-Agent shall in all cases be fully protected 
in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in 
accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders (or where required 
by the terms of this Agreement, the Lenders), and such request and 
any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding 
upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

(e) No Co-Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice 
of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless 
such Co-Agent shall have received notice from the Administrative 
Agent, a Lender or one of the Credit Parties referring to this 
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default or stating 
that such notice is a "notice of default." In the event that any 
Co-Agent receives such a notice from a Person other than the 
Administrative Agent, such Co-Agent shall give prompt notice thereof 
to the Administrative Agent.

(f) Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither any 
Co-Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, 
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations or 
warranties to it and that no act by any Co-Agent hereinafter taken, 
including any review of the affairs of any of the Credit Parties or 
any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute 
any representation or warranty by such Co-Agent to any Lender. Each 
Lender represents to each Co-Agent that it has, independently and 
without reliance upon such Co-Agent or any other Lender, and based on 
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its 
own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, 
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each 
of the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and made its 
own decision to make its loans and other financial accommodations 
hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents 
that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Co-Agent or 
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it 
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit 
analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action 
under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems 
necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, 
liabilities, assets, properties and condition (financial or 
otherwise) and creditworthiness of each of the Credit Parties and 
their respective Subsidiaries. Except for written materials received 
by any Co-Agent from any of the Credit Parties that any Lender has 
requested such Co-Agent to furnish, no Co-Agent shall have any duty 
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other 
information concerning the business, operations, property, financial 
and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties 
or any of their respective Subsidiaries which may come into the 
possession of such Co-Agent or any of its officers, directors, 
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

(g) Each Lender agrees to indemnify each Co-Agent in its 
capacity as such and each Co-Agent's officers, directors, employees, 
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates (to the extent not reimbursed 
by the Credit Parties and without limiting the obligation of the 
Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to the total loan 
percentages set forth opposite its name on Exhibit A hereto from and 

<PAGE>

against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, 
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including the 
allocated costs and expenses of in-house counsel) or disbursements of 
any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including without 
limitation at any time following the payment of the Notes) be 
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Co-Agent in any way 
relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, the financing 
thereunder, or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or any 
action taken or omitted by such Co-Agent under or in connection with 
any of the foregoing; PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for the 
payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, 
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or 
disbursements resulting from such Co-Agent's gross negligence or 
wilful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 13.14(h) shall 
survive the payment of the Notes and the Lender Debt.

(h) GE Capital, Congress and their respective affiliates 
may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any 
kind of business with the Credit Parties as though GE Capital or 
Congress, as the case may be, were not a Co-Agent hereunder. With 
respect to its pro rata share of the Advances made or renewed by it 
and any Note issued to it, GE Capital or Congress, as the case may 
be, shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any 
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not a Co-Agent. 
The terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include GE Capital and 
Congress in their individual capacity.

(i) Each Co-Agent may resign as a Co-Agent upon Written 
Notice to the Administrative Agent. In the event that any Co-Agent 
shall enter receivership or a proceeding in bankruptcy or insolvency 
shall be commenced by or against any Co-Agent, then Lenders, 
excluding the Lender which is such Co-Agent, having sixty-six and 
two-thirds per cent (66 2/3%) of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, 
may remove such Co-Agent under this Agreement.

(j) Each Co-Agent shall endeavor to exercise the same 
care in exercising its rights and duties under this Agreement as it 
exercises with respect to similar transactions in which it is 
involved and where no other co-lenders or participants are involved; 
PROVIDED that the liability of each Co-Agent for failing to do so 
shall be limited as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this 
Section 13.14.

(k) Each Co-Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel 
and other specialists and advisors (including affiliates of such 
Co-Agent) selected by it concerning all matters pertaining to such 
Co-Agent's duties hereunder. No Co-Agent shall be responsible for 
the negligence or misconduct of any such counsel and other 
specialists and advisors selected by it with reasonable care.

13.15. BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT. (a) This Agreement shall 
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and 
their respective successors and assigns, except that the obligation 
of the Lenders and any Issuing Lender to make Advances and other 
financial accommodations hereunder shall not inure to the benefit of 
any successors and assigns of the Borrowers. Without limiting the 
generality of the previous sentence, this Agreement shall also inure 
to the benefit of any of the parties referred to in Section 13.13(b) 
through which the Administrative Agent is entitled to execute its 
duties under the Loan Documents.

(b) The Borrowers may not assign or transfer any of their 
interests hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lenders. 
Each of the Lenders may make, carry or transfer its pro rata share of 
the Advances at, to or for the account of any of its branch offices 
or the office of one or more of its Affiliates.

(c) Each Lender may assign its rights and delegate its 
obligations under this Agreement and may assign, sell or grant 
participation in, all or any part of its pro rata share of any 
Advance or Advances made by it or its Revolving Commitment or any 
other interest herein or in its Notes to another bank or other 
financial institution (in the case of any assignment, pursuant to an 
assignment in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative 
Agent), in which event:

(i) in the case of an assignment, upon notice thereof by 
such Lender to the Borrowers, the assignee shall have, to the 
extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided therein), 
the same rights and benefits as it would have if it were such 
Lender hereunder and the holder of a Note, 

(ii) in the case of a participation by any Lender that is 
not an Agent, the participant shall not have any rights under 
this Agreement or any Note or any other Loan Document (the 
participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such 
participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by 
such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto which 
agreement shall not, in any event, grant to the participant the 
right of consent as to any matters under the Loan Documents other 
than those which require the consent of all Lenders except that 
the participant shall, solely for the purposes of Sections 2.9, 
2.12 and 3.8 hereof and in any event subject to Section 2.25 
hereof, be deemed to be a Lender with all applicable rights and 
obligations of a Lender under such Sections, and

(iii) in the case of a participation by any Lender that is 
an Agent, the participant shall not have any rights under this 
Agreement or any Note or any other Loan Document (the 
participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such 
participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by 
such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto which 
agreement shall not prevent such Lender from complying with the 
proviso to this clause (iii) below and shall require that the 
voting rights granted to the participant under such agreement 
shall be subject to the proviso to this clause (iii)), except 
that the participant shall, solely for the purposes of Sections 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
2.9, 2.12 and 3.8 hereof and in any event subject to Section 2.25 
hereof, be deemed to be a Lender with all applicable rights and 
obligations of a Lender under such Sections; PROVIDED, that if, 
in connection with any proposed action or inaction for which the 
consent of the Majority Lenders is required hereunder or for 
which a direction by the Majority Lenders may be given hereunder, 
a Lender that is an Agent that would otherwise vote in favor of 
such consent or direction is required to withhold its consent or 
direction by virtue of voting rights granted to one or more of 
its participants (each such Lender being referred to as a 
"Constrained Lender"), then, such Constrained Lender shall cast 
its vote in respect of such proposed consent or direction by 
apportioning its vote (on a ratable basis based on the relative 
percentages of beneficial interests in such Constrained Lender's 
Revolving Commitment) with respect thereto.

(d) Subject to the confidentiality requirement set forth in 
Section 13.18 hereof, each Lender may furnish any information 
concerning the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries in 
the possession of such Lender from time to time to assignees and 
participants (including prospective assignees and participants). 

(e) In the event that any Lender shall assign or sell all 
or any part of its pro rata share of any Advance or Advances made by 
it or its Revolving Commitment or any other interests herein or in 
its Notes, such Lender shall at the time of such assignment or sale 
give Written Notice to the Administrative Agent of the name and 
address of the assignee (including the name of the account officer if 
applicable). Further, and as a condition to the effectiveness of any 
such assignment or sale, the assignee shall pay to the Administrative 
Agent a fee of $2,500 to record such assignment or sale.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except 
as set forth in the proviso hereto, any partial assignment of the 
Revolving Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment shall be 
in an aggregate amount at least equal to $10,000,000 and any partial 
participation of the Revolving Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility 
Commitment shall be in an aggregate face (maximum) amount at least 
equal to $10,000,000; provided, however, that the foregoing 
limitations with respect to partial assignment of the Revolving Loan 
and the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment and partial 
participation of the Revolving Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility 
Commitment shall be reduced to $5,000,000 in the case of up to three 
participants of Congress and any replacements thereof and any 
assignees of such participants or replacements thereof.

(g) The Borrowers will assist each Lender in effectuating 
any such assignments, sales or participation by each Lender in 
whatever manner such Lender reasonably deems necessary.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this 
Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in 
all or any portion of its rights to receive monies under this 
Agreement (including, without limitation, under its share of the 
Revolving Loan and Notes held by such Lender) in favor of any Federal 
Reserve Bank of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(i) Any assignment and delegation by a Lender of any 
portion of its Revolving Commitment made in accordance with the terms 
hereof after the Closing Date shall relieve such Lender of the 
portion of its Revolving Commitment so assigned and delegated.

(j) (i) Subject to clause (vi) below, in the event that 
any Lender which is an Agent (the "Agent Lender") intends to sell, 
assign or transfer (other than by participation) any interest in its 
Notes and Revolving Credit Commitment (a "Restricted Interest"), and 
as a result of such sale, assignment or transfer (a "Restricted 
Transfer") the percentage interest of the Agent Lender in the 
Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall become less than that held by 
any one or more Lenders for their own account unparticipated (each, a 
"Benefitted Lender"), the Agent Lender shall notify each Benefitted 
Lender in writing not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the 
date of such Restricted Transfer of the amount, principal financial 
terms and proposed closing date of such Restricted Transfer and the 
percentage interest in the Aggregate Revolving Commitments of the 
Agent Lender as a result of such Restricted Transfer and such written 
notice shall constitute an offer to each Benefitted Lender to 
participate (to the exclusion of the Agent Lender) in the Restricted 
Transfer to the extent of the "Required Percentage" (as defined 
below), upon the same terms and conditions as those of the Restricted 
Transfer and pursuant to substantially the same documentation as that 
used by the Agent Lender in effecting its sale. Each Benefitted 
Lender shall respond in writing to such offer not less than three (3) 
Business Days after receiving such offer and shall be deemed to have 
rejected such offer if no written response is received by the Agent 
Lender within such time period. Acceptance by a Benefitted Lender of 
such offer shall require that such Benefitted Lender consummate the 
subject sale at the time by which the Agent Lender is required to 
close under the terms described in the offer.

(ii) No Benefitted Lender shall be entitled to participate 
in a Restricted Transfer as to any portion of the Restricted Interest 
which was not accepted for sale by any other Benefitted Lender. The 
Agent Lender may sell to its intended transferee any portion of the 
Restricted Interest as to which a rejection was received or deemed to 
have been received under this Section 13.15(j).

(iii) In the event that a Benefitted Lender defaults in 
consummating a sale for which acceptance was given under this Section 
13.15(j), such Benefitted Lender shall purchase from the Agent 
Lender, at the request of the Agent Lender, the Required Percentage 
of the Restricted Interest which such Benefitted Lender was obligated 
to sell to the intended transferee. 

(iv) For the purposes of this Section 13.15(j), the term 
"Required Percentage" shall mean that percentage which, assuming each 
Benefitted Lender entitled to notice under this Section 13.15(j) 
participates in the Restricted Transfer, will result in the Agent 
Lender and such Benefitted Lenders holding the same percentage in the 
Aggregate Revolving Commitments immediately after giving effect to 
such Restricted Transfer and the participation by the Agent Lender 
and such Benefitted Lenders therein.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(v) The provisions of this Section 13.15(j) are intended 
solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders 
and no Credit Party shall be entitled to enforce or otherwise be 
entitled to the benefits of this Section 13.15(j) (as a third party 
beneficiary or otherwise).

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.15(j), no Agent shall be 
required to issue a notice of an intended Restricted Transfer or 
otherwise comply with the requirements of clause (i) above if such 
Agent shall give notice of its resignation as Administrative Agent or 
Co-Agent, as the case may be (which resignation may be conditioned 
upon the consummation of such Restricted Transfer), on or prior to 
the time such notification under clause (i) would be required, and 
such resignation, subject to Section 13.13(i) or Section 13.13(j) 
hereof, as applicable, shall be effective no later than the date of 
consummation of such Restricted Transfer.

(k) Each Lender shall upon receipt of request from any 
other Lender disclose to such requesting Lender the identity and 
participating interest of any participant of such Lender that has 
been granted a right to consent as to any matters under the Loan 
Documents other than those which require the consent of all Lenders.

13.16 COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE SIGNATURE. (a) This 
Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto individually or in 
any combination, in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be 
an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the 
same agreement.

(b) Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page 
to this Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a 
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

13.17 INVALIDITY. Whenever possible, each provision of 
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective 
and valid under all applicable laws and regulations. If, however, 
any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid 
under any such law or regulation, it shall be deemed modified to 
conform to the minimum requirements of such law or regulation, or, if 
for any reason it is not deemed so modified, it shall be ineffective 
and invalid only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity 
without the remainder thereof or any of the remaining provisions of 
this Agreement being prohibited or invalid.

13.18 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender agrees to take normal 
and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the 
confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" by 
any Credit Party and provided to it by any Credit Party or any 
Subsidiary of any Credit Party, or by the Administrative Agent on 
such Credit Party's or Subsidiary's behalf, in connection with this 
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its 
Affiliates shall use any such information for any purpose or in any 
manner other than pursuant to the terms contemplated by this 
Agreement; except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes 
generally available to the public other than as a result of a 
disclosure by such Lender, or (ii) was or becomes available on a 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
non-confidential basis from a source other than any Credit Party, 
provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement 
with any Credit Party known to the Lender; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, 
that any Lender may disclose such information (A) at the request or 
pursuant to any requirement of any governmental authority to which 
the Lender is subject or in connection with an examination of such 
Lender by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or other court 
process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions 
of any applicable requirement of law; (D) to the extent reasonably 
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which any 
Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates and a Credit 
Party may be party, (E) to the extent reasonably required in 
connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any 
other Loan Document, and (F) to such Lender's independent auditors 
and other professional advisors. A Lender disclosing information 
under clause (B) or (D) of the immediately preceding sentence shall 
give reasonable prior notice to the Borrowers thereof, to the extent 
not prohibited by law, provided, that no Lender shall be liable to 
any Person for failure to give any such notice. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Credit Parties authorize each Lender to disclose to 
any participant or assignee (each, a "Transferee") and to any 
prospective Transferee, such financial and other information in such 
Lender's possession concerning any Credit Party or its Subsidiaries 
which has been delivered to any Agent or any Lender pursuant to this 
Agreement or which has been delivered to any Agent or any Lender by 
any Credit Party in connection with the Lenders' credit evaluation of 
the Credit Party prior to entering into this Agreement; PROVIDED 
that, unless otherwise agreed by the Credit Party, such Transferee 
agrees in writing to such Lender to keep such information 
confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders hereunder. 
In no event shall the Administrative Agent, any Co-Agent or any 
Lender be liable under this Section 13.18 for any direct, indirect, 
consequential or punitive damages resulting from disclosure permitted 
under this Section 13.18.
