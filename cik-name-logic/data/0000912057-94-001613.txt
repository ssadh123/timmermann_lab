SNAP-ON TOOLS CORPORATION CHANGES NAME TO SNAP-ON INCORPORATED;
SHAREHOLDERS RE-ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS; QUARTERLY DIVIDEND DECLARED

KENOSHA, Wis.--April 22, 1994--Snap-on Tools Corporation said it will change its
name to Snap-on Incorporated, reflecting the Corporation's expansion beyond its
traditional business of manufacturing and marketing hand tools for professional
automotive technicians. Shareholders approved the name change at the
Corporation's annual meeting held in Racine, Wisconsin today. Shareholders also
re-elected four members of the board of directors.

Snap-on Incorporated will operate through its four customer-focused operating
units: Snap-on Tools, the Corporation's heritage business; Snap-on Diagnostics,
which provides diagnostic and shop equipment to growing worldwide markets; Snap-
on Industrial, which provides industrial tooling through both direct sales and
industrial distributors; and Snap-on Financial Services, Inc., which provides
credit and leasing programs for customers of the Corporation's other three
businesses.

Shareholders re-elected four directors to the Corporation's board: Bruce S.
Chelberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Whitman Corporation;
Roxanne J. Decyk, vice president-marketing and sales, polymers, Amoco Chemical
Company; Raymond F. Farley, retired chief executive officer and president,
S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc.; and Arthur L. Kelly, managing partner, KEL
Enterprises Ltd. The board is composed of nine members.

The board of directors declared a second quarter dividend of 27 cents per share,
payable June 10, 1994, to shareholders of record May 20, 1994. The Corporation
has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends since 1939.

Snap-on is a leading producer and distributor of quality hand and power tools,
diagnostic equipment, and tool storage units for professional mechanics and
industry.
