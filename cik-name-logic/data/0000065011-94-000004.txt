Item 5. Other Events.

Reference is made to Part II - OTHER INFORMATION, Item 1, Legal Proceedings. as
reported in Meredith Corporation's Form 10-Q report for the quarterly period
ended December 31, 1993.

On March 14, 1994, Meredith Corporation received a favorable decision from the
United States Tax Court relating to the federal income tax deficiency notices
for its 1986 through 1990 tax years.

The dominant issue, determined in favor of the Company, involved the tax basis
and ability to amortize the Ladies' Home Journal subscriber relationships. 
Because the Tax Court applied the 1993 decision of the United States Supreme
Court in Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States to the facts of the
Company's case, the Company believes an appeal by the Internal Revenue Service
of the Tax Court's opinion is unlikely.

If the Internal Revenue Service does not appeal the Tax Court's decision, the
Company has no remaining exposure to the $12 million potential tax cost that
was previously reported. In addition, the Company believes this decision may
have a material and favorable impact on its net earnings.
