for at least six months may, on such holder's behalf and
on behalf of all other holders similarly situated,

successor, if such Trustee fails after written request
thereof by such holder to comply with the provisions of
subsection (a) of this Section 7.08.

(d) For the purposes of this Section 7.08 the
Trustee shall be deemed to have a conflicting interest
with respect to the Securities of any series if an Event
of Default (exclusive of any period of grace or
requirement of notice) has occurred with respect to
Securities of such series and:

(1) the Trustee is trustee under another
indenture under which any other securities, or
certificates of interest or participation in any
other securities, of the Company, the Guarantor or
any other obligor on the Securities are outstanding
or is trustee for more than one outstanding series of
securities, as hereinafter defined, under a single
indenture of the Company, the Guarantor or any other
obligor on the Securities, unless such other
indenture is a collateral trust indenture under which
the only collateral consists of Securities issued
under this Indenture, provided that there shall be
excluded from the operation of this paragraph, this
Indenture with respect to the Securities of any other
series outstanding, the Indenture dated as of May 15,

indentures (and all series of securities issued
thereunder) are wholly unsecured and rank equally,
and such other indenture or indentures (and such
series) are hereafter qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, unless the Commission shall
have found and declared by order pursuant to
subsection (b) of Section 305 or subsection (c) of
Section 307 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
that differences exist between the provisions of
this Indenture with respect to Securities of such
series and one or more other series, or the
provisions of this Indenture and the provisions of
such other indenture or indentures (or such series),
which are so likely to involve a material conflict of
interest as to make it necessary in the public
interest or for the protection of investors to
disqualify the Trustee from acting as such under this
Indenture with respect to Securities of such series
and such other series, or under this Indenture and
such other indenture or indentures, or (B) the
Company shall have sustained the burden of proving,
on application to the Commission and after
opportunity for hearing thereon, that the trusteeship
under this Indenture with respect to Securities of
such series and such other series, or under this
Indenture and such other indenture, is not so likely
to involve a material conflict of interest as to make
it necessary in the public interest or for the
protection of investors to disqualify the Trustee
from acting as such under this Indenture with respect
to Securities of such series and such other series,
or under this Indenture and one of such indentures,

on the Securities who is currently engaged in the
business of

underwriting, except that (A) one individual may be
a director and/or an executive officer of the Trustee

Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor on the
Securities, but may not be at the same time an executive
officer of both the Trustee and the Company, the
Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities;
(B) if and so long as the number of directors of the
Trustee in office is more than nine, one additional
individual may be a director and/or an executive
officer of the Trustee and a director of the Company,

<PAGE>

administrator, testamentary or inter vivos trustee,
guardian, committee or conservator, or in any other
similar capacity an aggregate of 25% or more of the
voting securities or of any class of security, of any
person, the beneficial ownership of a specified
percentage of which would have constituted a
conflicting interest under paragraph (6), (7) or (8)
of this subsection (d). As to any such securities of
which the Trustee acquired ownership through becoming
executor, administrator or testamentary trustee of an
estate which included them, the provisions of the
preceding sentence shall not apply, for a period of
two years from the date of such acquisition, to the
extent that such securities included in such estate
do not exceed 25% of such voting securities or 25% of
any such class of security. Promptly after the date
of the occurrence of any such Event of Default and
annually in each succeeding year that the Securities
or any series thereof remain in default, the Trustee
shall make a check of its holdings of such securities
in any of the above-mentioned capacities as of such
dates. If the Company, the Guarantor or any other
obligor on the Securities fails to make payment in

Securities when and as the same becomes due and
payable and such failure continues for 30 days
thereafter, the Trustee shall make a prompt check of
its holdings of such securities in any of the above-
mentioned capacities as of the date of the expiration
of such 30-day period, and after such date,

paragraph (9), all such securities so held by the

such failure shall continue, be considered as though
beneficially owned by the Trustee for the purposes of
paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) of this subsection (d) or

(10) except under the circumstances described in
paragraphs (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of Section 7.13(b),
the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company,
the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities.

The specifications of percentages in paragraphs (5) to (9),
inclusive, of this subsection (d) shall not be construed as indicating that
the ownership of such percentages of the securities of a person is or is not
necessary or sufficient to constitute direct or indirect control for the
purposes of paragraph (3) or (7) of this subsection (d).

For the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7), (8) and (9) of this
subsection (d) only, (A) the terms 'security' and 'securities' shall include

obligation to repay moneys lent to a person by one or more banks, trust
companies or banking firms, or any certificate of interest or participation in
any such note or evidence of indebtedness; (B) an obligation shall be deemed
to be in default when a default in payment of principal shall have continued
for 30 days or more and shall not have been cured; and (C) the Trustee shall
not be deemed to be the owner or holder of (i) any security which it holds as
collateral security (as trustee or otherwise) for an obligation which is not
in default as defined in clause (B) above, or (ii) any security which it holds
as collateral security under this Indenture, irrespective of any default
hereunder, or (iii) any security which it holds as agent for collection, or as
custodian, escrow agent or depositary, or in any similar representative

provided, however, that any voting securities of an issuer
shall be deemed outstanding if any person other than the
issuer is entitled to exercise the voting rights thereof.

(E) A security shall be deemed to be of the same
class as another security if both securities confer upon
the holder or holders thereof substantially the same
rights and privileges, provided, however, that, in the
case of secured evidences of indebtedness, all of which
are issued under a single indenture, differences in the
interest rates or maturity dates of various series thereof
shall not be deemed sufficient to constitute such series
different classes, and provided further that, in the case
of unsecured evidences of indebtedness, differences in the
interest rate or maturity dates thereof shall not be
deemed sufficient to constitute them securities of
different classes, whether or not they are issued under a
single indenture.

(f) Except in the case of a default in the payment of the
principal of or interest on any Securities, or in the payment of any sinking
or purchase fund installment, the Trustee shall not be required to resign as
provided by this Section 7.08 if the Trustee shall have sustained the burden
of proving, on application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing
thereon, that (i) the default under this Indenture may be cured or waived
during a reasonable period and under the procedures described in such
application, and (ii) a stay of the Trustee's duty to resign will not be
inconsistent with the interests of holders of such series of Securities. The
filing of such an application shall automatically stay the performance of the
duty to resign until the Commission orders otherwise. Any resignation of the
Trustee shall become effective only upon the appointment of a successor
trustee and such successor's acceptance of such appointment."

SECTION 2.04. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 7.09. Section 7.09 of the
Original Indenture is hereby amended to read as follows:

-13-
<PAGE>
"SECTION 7.09. REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY OF
TRUSTEE. There shall always be at least one Trustee
hereunder. The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a
corporation organized and doing business as a commercial
bank under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof or of the District of Columbia or a corporation or
other person permitted to act as a trustee by the
Commission, and, in each case, authorized under such laws
to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000, and subject
to supervision or examination by Federal, State or
District of Columbia authority. If such corporation
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising
or examining authority, then for the purposes of this
Section 7.09, the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 7.09, the Trustee shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in
this Article Seven. No obligor upon the Securities or
person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by
or under common control with such obligor shall serve as
Trustee."

SECTION 2.05. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 7.13. Subsection (a) of
Section 7.13 of the Original Indenture is hereby amended to read as follows:

"(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of
this Section 7.13, if the Trustee shall be or shall become
a creditor, directly or indirectly, secured or unsecured,
of the Company, of the Guarantor or of any other obligor
on the Securities within three months prior to a default,
as defined in subsection (c) of this Section, or
subsequent to such a default, then, unless and until such
default shall be cured, the Trustee shall set apart and
hold in a special account for the benefit of the Trustee
individually, the holders of the Securities for which it
is acting as Trustee, and the holders of other indenture
securities (as defined in subsection (c) of this Section
7.13):

(1) an amount equal to any and all reductions in the
amount due and owing upon any claim as such creditor in respect
of principal or interest, effected after the beginning of such
three months' period, and valid as against the Company, the
Guarantor or such other obligor and its other creditors, except
any such reduction resulting from the receipt or disposition of
any property described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, or
from the exercise of any right of set-off which the Trustee
could have exercised if a petition in bankruptcy had been filed
by or

-14-
<PAGE>
against the Company or such other obligor, as the case may be,
upon the date of such default; and

(2) all property received by the Trustee in respect of
any claims as such creditor, either as security therefor, or in
satisfaction or composition thereof, or otherwise, after the
beginning of such three months' period, or an amount equal to
the proceeds of any such property if disposed of, subject,
however, to the rights, if any, of the Company or such other
obligor and its other creditors in such property or such
proceeds.

Nothing herein contained, however, shall affect the right
of the Trustee:

(A) to retain for its own account (i) payments made on
account of any such claim by any person (other than the Company
or such other obligor, as the case may be) who is liable
thereon, and (ii) the proceeds of the bona fide sale of any
claim by the Trustee to a third person, and (iii) distributions
made in cash, securities or other property in respect of claims
filed against the Company or such other obligor, as the case
may be, in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for
reorganization pursuant to Title 11 of the United States Code
or applicable State laws;

(B) to realize, for its own account, upon any property
held by it as security for any such claim, if such property was
so held prior to the beginning of such three months' period;

(C) to realize, for its own account, but only to the
extent of the claim hereinafter mentioned, upon any property
held by it as security for any such claim, if such claim was
created after the beginning of such three months' period and
such property was received as security therefor simultaneously
with the creation thereof, and if the Trustee shall sustain the
burden of proving that at the time such property was so
received, the Trustee had no reasonable cause to believe that a
default, as defined in subsection (c) of this Section 7.13
would occur within three months; or

(D) to receive payment on any claim referred to in
paragraph (B) or (C), against the release of any property held
as security for such claim as provided in such paragraph (B) or
(C), as the case may be, to the extent of the fair value of
such property.

For the purposes of paragraphs (B), (C) and (D),
property substituted after the beginning of such three
months' period for property

-15-
<PAGE>
held as security at the time of such substitution
shall, to the extent of the fair value of the property
released, have the same status as the property
released, and to the extent that any claim referred to
in any of such paragraphs is created in renewal of or
in substitution for or for the purpose of repaying or
refunding any preexisting claim of the Trustee as such
creditor, such claim shall have the same status as
such preexisting claim.

If the Trustee shall be required to account, the
funds and property held in such special account and the
proceeds thereof shall be apportioned among the Trustee,
the holders of Securities for which it is acting as
Trustee, and the holders of other indenture securities in
such manner that the Trustee, such Securityholders and the
holders of other indenture securities realize, as a result
of payments from such special account and payments of
dividends on claims filed against the Company or such
other obligor, as the case may be, in bankruptcy or
receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant
to Title 11 of the United States Code or applicable State
law, the same percentage of their respective claims,
figured before crediting to the claim of the Trustee
anything on account of the receipt by it from the Company
or such other obligor, as the case may be, of the funds
and property in such special account and before crediting
to the respective claims of the Trustee, such
Securityholders, and the holders of other indenture
securities dividends on claims filed against the Company
or such other obligor, as the case may be, in bankruptcy
or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization
pursuant to Title 11 of the United States Code or
applicable State law, but after crediting thereon receipts
on account of the indebtedness represented by their
respective claims from all sources other than from such
dividends and from the funds and property so held in such
special account. As used in this paragraph, with respect
to any claim, the term 'dividends' shall include any
distribution with respect to such claim in bankruptcy or
receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant
to Title 11 of the United States Code or applicable State
law, whether such distribution is made in cash, securities
or other property, but shall not include any such
distribution with respect to the secured portion, if any,
of such claim. The court in which such bankruptcy,
receivership or proceeding for reorganization is pending
shall have jurisdiction (i) to apportion among the
Trustee, such Securityholders, and the holders of other
indenture securities, in accordance with the provisions of
this paragraph, the funds and property held in such
special account and the proceeds thereof, or (ii) in lieu
of such apportionment, in whole or in part, to give to the
provisions of this paragraph due consideration in
determining the fairness of the 

-16-
<PAGE>
distributions to be made to the Trustee, such
Securityholders and the holders of other indenture
securities with respect to their respective claims, in
which event it shall not be necessary to liquidate or to
appraise the value of any securities or other property
held in such special account or as security for any such
claim, or to make a specific allocation of such
distributions as between the secured and unsecured
portions of such claim, or otherwise to apply the
provisions of this paragraph as a mathematical formula.

Any Trustee who has resigned or been removed after
the beginning of such three months' period shall be
subject to the provisions of this subsection (a) as though
such resignation or removal had not occurred. If any
Trustee has resigned or been removed prior to the
beginning of such three months' period, it shall be
subject to the provisions of this subsection (a) if and
only if the following conditions exist:

(i) the receipt of property or reduction of claim which
would have given rise to the obligation to account, if such
Trustee had continued, as trustee, occurred after the beginning
of such three months' period; and

(ii) such receipt of property or reduction of claim
occurred within three months after such resignation or removal.

In every case commenced under the Bankruptcy Act of
1898, or any amendment thereto enacted prior to November
6, 1978, all references to periods of three months shall
be deemed to be references to periods of four months."

Section 2.05 of the Original Indenture shall be further amended by adding the

SECTION 3.05. ADDITION OF NEW SECTION 2.09. The Original
Indenture shall be amended by adding the following new Section 2.09.

-20-
<PAGE>
"SECTION 2.09. SECURITIES IN GLOBAL FORM;
DEPOSITARIES. (a) Each Global Security shall: (i)
represent and be denominated in an aggregate amount equal
to the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of the
series to be represented by such Global Security, (ii) be
registered in the name of either the Depository for such
Global Security or the nominee of such Depository, (iii)
be delivered by the Trustee to such Depository or pursuant
to such Depository's written instruction and (iv) bear a
legend substantially to the following effect: 'Unless and
until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities
in definitive form, this Global Security may not be
transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a
nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the
Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the
Depository or by the Depository or any nominee to a
successor Depository or a nominee of any successor
Depository.' The notation of the record owner's interest
in such Global Security upon the original issuance thereof
shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with the
original issuance of each beneficial owner's interest in
such Global Security. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee shall have no
responsibility, obligation or liability with respect to:
(x) the maintenance, review or accuracy of the records of
the Depository or of any of its participating
organizations with respect to any ownership interest in or
payments with respect to such Global Security, (y) any
communication with or delivery of any notice (including
notices of redemption) with respect to the series of
Securities represented by the Global Security to any
person having any ownership interest in such Global
Security or to any of the Depository's participating
organizations or (z) any payment made on account of any
beneficial ownership interest in such Global Security.

(b) If any Security of a series is issuable in the
form of a Global Security or Securities, each such Global
Security may provide that it shall represent the aggregate
amount of outstanding Securities of such series from time
to time endorsed thereon and may also provide that the
aggregate amount of outstanding Securities of such series
represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to
reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of a Global Security
to reflect the amount of outstanding Securities of a
series represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee
and in such manner as shall be specified on such Global
Security. Any instructions by the Company with respect to
a Global Security, after its initial issuance, shall be in
writing but need not comply with Section 14.03 of this
Indenture.

(c) Each Depository designated pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.01 of this Indenture for a Global
Security must, at the time of

-21-
<PAGE>
its designation and at all times while it serves as a
depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any
other applicable statute or regulation. If at any time
the Depository for the Securities of a series notifies
the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue
as Depository for the Securities of such series or if
at any time the Depository for the Securities of such
series shall no longer be eligible under this Section
2.09, the Company shall appoint a successor Depository
with respect to the Securities of such series. If a
successor Depository for the Securities of such series
is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after
the Company receives such notice or learns of such
ineligibility, the Company shall execute and the
Company shall direct the Trustee to authenticate and
deliver definitive Securities of such series in
authorized denominations in exchange for the Global
Security or Securities. Upon receipt of such
direction, the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and
deliver the definitive Securities of such series in the
same aggregate principal amount as the Global Security or
Securities representing such series in exchange for such
Global Security or Securities, in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (e) of this Section 2.09, without
any further corporate action by the Company.

(d) The Company may at any time and in its sole
discretion determine that the Securities of any series
issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall
no longer be represented by such Global Security or
Securities. In such event, the Company will execute and
upon receipt of a written order from the Company, the
Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver
Securities of such series in definitive form and in
authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or
Securities representing such series in exchange for such
Global Security or Securities, in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (e) of this Section 2.09 without
any further corporate action by the Company.

(e) Upon any exchange hereunder of the Global
Security or Securities for Securities in definitive form,
such Global Security or Securities shall be canceled by
the Trustee. Securities issued hereunder in exchange for
the Global Security or Securities shall be registered in
such names and in such authorized denominations as the
Depository for such Global Security, pursuant to
instructions from its direct or indirect participants or
otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall
deliver such definitive Securities in exchange for the
Global Security or Securities to the persons in whose name
such definitive Securities have been registered in
accordance with the directions of the Depository.

Original Indenture is hereby amended by adding thereto as a new second
paragraph the following:

"If the Securities of any series are issued in the
form of one or more Global Securities, the Depository
therefor may grant proxies to Persons having a beneficial
ownership in such Global Security or Securities for
purposes of voting or otherwise responding to any request
for consent, waiver or other action which the holder of
such Security is entitled to grant or take under this
Indenture and the Trustee shall accept such proxies for
the purposes granted; provided that neither the Trustee
nor the Company shall have any obligation with respect to
the grant of or solicitation by the Depository of such
proxies."

the Original Indenture is hereby amended to read as follows:

Securities in accordance with the terms of the Securities,
any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture. 
Except with respect to any Global Securities, if the fully
registered Securities of any series bear interest, each
installment of interest on the Securities of such series
may at the option of the Company be paid by mailing a
check or checks for such interest payable to the person
entitled thereto pursuant to Section 2.03 to the address
of such person as it appears on the Register of the
Securities of such series on the applicable Record Date
for such interest payment."

respect of such payment shall not occur unless the Company

subject to redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the issuer), in either case, in such
amounts and maturing at such times that the

their respective maturities and interest payment
dates will provide funds sufficient to pay the
principal, premium, if any, and interest to
maturity, or to the Redemption Date, as the case
may be, with respect to all of the Securities to
be paid or redeemed, as such principal, premium
and interest become due, provided that the
Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed
to apply the proceeds of said obligations to the
payment of said principal, premium, if any, and
interest with respect to said Securities."
